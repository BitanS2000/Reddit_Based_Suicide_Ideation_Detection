sober.\\n\\npeople are afraid of emotions, but emotions can not kill us.  emotions are there to give us messages.  sadness, grief, anger, all of that has a purpose, we just have to stay with it to get the message.  \\n\\nthe fact that sometimes you can't cry tells me that perhaps you have a lot of emotions bottled up in your body.  there are people who can help you process it all.  unfortunately, drugs can't help with that.  you have to let yourself feel things, process in a safe way.  probably you have some trauma from young age to process.  maybe listen to garbor mate, he has a lot of wisdom and compassion to offer. cocaine withdrawals aren't very physical but mental. you can do this just find something that you want more than the drug and start going to get the other things you need. one day at a time. don't worry about the day after, next week, and year from now, or a decade. just take it one day at a time. focus on just staying clean for today. when you think about the future and how you'll be clean next week, it gets extremely overwhelming and looks impossible, when one day is hard enough. just focus on staying clean for today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow i had to deal with other addictions. what worked for me was to quit cold turkey. at the start, it didn't work, i used to wake up in high spirits then relapse 10 hours later, other days i managed more hours than that, the key is to try everyday until one day you succeed. the more you try, the more you know what to expect and how to deal with it. what helped the most was getting super busy and everytime i felt the urge, i did something intense like extremely long walks. it is hard but doable if you try. hey. first off, you\\u2019re not crazy. \\u2661\\n\\n what you wrote? \\n\\nthat\\u2019s addiction. that\\u2019s what it does. it makes you feel empty and broken without it, like you can\\u2019t survive unless you\\u2019re high. but you\\u2019re not alone in this, and you're not the only one who's felt this way.\\n\\ni\\u2019ve been there. fully in it. and i promise you, there is another side. i made it out. it\\u2019s not easy. it\\u2019s messy and brutal, and it hurts like hell sometimes. but it absolutely gets better.\\n\\nwithdrawal is hell. your brain lies to you. it tells you nothing will ever feel good again, that you\\u2019ll never be okay. but that\\u2019s not true. it just takes time for your system to reset. you\\u2019re not weak. your brain\\u2019s just been rewired, and it needs help to come back.\\n\\nwanting to quit and not quit at the same time is normal. it\\u2019s the most honest part of addiction. but the fact that you\\u2019re even asking these questions means something in you wants to live. that part is still in there. that part matters.\\n\\nyou can\\u2019t do this on your own. you need support. i don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s a doctor, a detox center, a therapist, na, a support group, whatever you can get to. real help, from people who know what they\\u2019re doing. because this is too big to fight alone.\\n\\nand please stop beating yourself up. you didn\\u2019t ask for this.\\n\\n you\\u2019re not a bad person. you\\u2019re a human in pain, using what you had to survive. that\\u2019s not a weakness that\\u2019s survival. but now it\\u2019s time to come up for air. \\n\\nsobriety might feel empty and cold at first, yeah. the thing i hated the most was trying to not let my brain trick me. i had to separate myself from that concept that my brain and me are rhe same. \\n\\nin this context *they're not* the same *at all*\\n\\nas someone else mentioned, get help from real people who have been there. there's a lot of strange glamorized anecdotes out there and i found that they made me feel more isolated. find the ugly and the depraved. it's better to be prepared for all. \\n\\nbut it\\u2019s only temporary. slowly, life starts to fill back in. you start to feel things again. you start to laugh without being high. you start to actually like yourself. i swear it happens. just not overnight. \\n\\nyou\\u2019re still in there. you\\u2019re not your addiction. you\\u2019re not broken. you\\u2019re in the middle of a war, but you can win it. i know because i did.\\n\\nyou don\\u2019t have to believe in yourself yet. i\\u2019ll believe in you for now. you\\u2019ve got this. one day at a time. even if all you do today is not use, that\\u2019s enough. that\\u2019s a win. keep going.\\n\\ni can't remember who it's from but a quote that helps me alot is that if the first step seems like too much, make it smaller. \\n\\ntoday. today i won't use. \\n\\nor, maybe even for the next 5 minutes. \\n\\n\\ncelebrate the small victories and nourish them to bigger ones. \\n\\nbe kind when you fuck up, because you will. \\n\\nsurround yourself with love and comfort and pretend during this process that you are dealing with your best friend in the whole world. \\n\\nhow would you guide them? \\n\\nwith love and

forever addict) the only way is to go cold turkey and distant yourself from all that enables or gives/sells you coke or any alternatives. its hard, but its the only way that truly worked for me...( im a clean addict for the last 20 years) hi. you\\u2019re not crazy.. you\\u2019re dealing with something difficult. while i have partied a lot in my life.. maybe i\\u2019m one of the lucky ones who didn\\u2019t get into a full blown addiction. i\\u2019ve had friends tho that were highly addicted to cocaine and to stop you sometimes need to change your environment, stop spending time with people who do cocaine and just start fresh. i get that it\\u2019s easier said than done but if you take a long enough vacation from the substance you\\u2019ll notice you don\\u2019t need it to be happy or to give you confidence. it take time and effort and it\\u2019s good to have some support people who are sober and don\\u2019t trigger you. if anything, mini steps are better than nothing. i wish you the best and sorry it\\u2019s been hard. this world can be a traumadumpster and i feel you. reach out if you wanna chat more i needed a 90 day in patient rehab and then i lived at and managed a recovery house for a year and then i lived with a guy from the recovery house. it took a long time. \\n\\ni spent so many years running the game that i didn\\u2019t know what i thought was fun anymore. i hadn\\u2019t watched tv in five years at that point. i had to spend time and rediscover myself and who i was without the drugs. you aren't crazy, but coke is. get help. reddit can't do this for you. you take shrooms. i\\u2019ve never used cocaine. and yet i feel all the suffering you\\u2019re talking about. it\\u2019s all real every day suffering, without ever using. it\\u2019s part of being human. you just have to human long enough to kind of get used to it.\\n\\nthen, when things get steady and quiet enough, you\\u2019ll be able to tune into small moments of novelty. and you\\u2019ll learn to grab those moments in just the right way, so they can be sustained for a little longer.\\n\\nyou\\u2019ll learn to savor those moments in a way that they last, in a more poignant way than they ever could when you were tripping on the midst of a cocaine binge. \\n\\nand you\\u2019ll recognize that what you crave more than anything else, are the quiet boring novel moments that are worth waiting for. \\n\\nand you\\u2019ll make a practice of that, and it will be the most brilliant thing you\\u2019ve ever experienced, and you\\u2019ll decide you don\\u2019t want anything to ever get in the way of that seemingly small but infinite high. \\n\\nand you\\u2019ll be sustained by that level of sublime personal bliss, and never look back. this is not advice, but some people use less hard drugs as crutches. talk to your doctor delete the numbers in your phone connected to the connections. when it\\u2019s hard to attain the more undesirable it becomes get a therapist at least to discuss these feelings with, having someone to listen and analyze each question you raised without judgement is immensely beneficial. wanting and not wanting to quit is normal. remember the not is fear of everything you\\u2019ve been running from by using. the drug makes you feel safe, its how you cope. you will have to learn new ways to feel safe and cope with life. replacement behaviors. it\\u2019s possible but painful. you can get to the other side but ask for help. don\\u2019t do it alone. rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. there are such unfortunates. they are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. they are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. their chances are less than average. there are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.\\n\\nour stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. if you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it-then you are ready to take certain steps.\\n\\nat some of these we balked. we thought we could find an easier, softer way. but we could not. with all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. my friend, please check in to a detox at a rehab center. they have staff that manage your withdrawal symptoms etc. i've met so many fortunate folks at the rehab i attended who had complete turnaround. they have all those doctors, nurses and therapy staff on hand 24/7. obviously get help but that aside:\\n\\n-you\\u2019re not crazy. you\\u2019re fighting addiction of one of the most addictive and euphoric drugs. this wouldn\\u2019t be easy at all for anyone.\\n\\n\\n-understand dopamine and find healthy highs. go for a walk, use sleep, eat properly, go on spa days. bordering on obsessive self care is the way forward here.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n-consider tapering slowly, ie reducing weekly intake in parts, skipping days and not binging on next consumption,\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n-avoid environments where you are more likely to consume. this means friends who use, bars, parties or anywhere else. if your home is that, consider staying with a relative or a clean friend for a while. our environments are massive when it comes to breaking and maintaining behaviours\\n\\n\\n-find good substitutes. drugs were taking up a lot of your time, and that time will not be easily passed if you don\\u2019t fill it with something. don\\u2019t expect it to be as euphoric as coke, but this can be helpful see a psychiatrist and then get into therapy. learn some coping mechanisms in therapy to deal with all this. medication may help with some of it, and the psychiatrist would be the one to see about that if not a regular doc may be able to help. i am substance use professional please feel free to dm and i can help you resource a bit if you want.\\u00a0 coke withdrawal must be hard, but you already understand you are using it to avoid feeling and thinking about other stuff. the hardest thing is learning to simply accept everything you are feeling. to rest in it. to let it just be. it\\u2019s okay to feel empty and sad and emotions. it\\u2019s ok to feel bad about yourself. it will pass once you let it feel and process. when you are feeling those try journaling. or i dare say ask chatgpt to ask you questions to get to the root of your feelings. focus on the present moment. i mean, you may try to paint a picture of your feelings related to past events. focus on now though. what _now_ is getting you in this funk?\\n\\nfocus on what you can control.\\naccept the things you cannot control.\\n\\ni think meditation helps a lot for stuff like this too. the goal isn\\u2019t no thoughts. the goal isn\\u2019t no feelings. the goal is to just sit without distraction. let yourself feel and think whatever you feel or think. just let it happen. eventually you can move towards _noticing_ your breath and _noticing_ your thoughts. but for beginning just practice being ok with what you feel.\\n\\n\\nlast i seriously think self-hypnosis can help with all of this. the book \\u201cinstant self hypnosis\\u201d is good. you can use it to tackle how you are feeling. to tackle the addiction. to gain some control and confidence back. the process usually can  last a few days. so redo it every few days.\\n\\nyou don\\u2019t even have to quit coke. just take a break for a week or two. see where you get. most of all don\\u2019t avoid feeling like shit. just let it happen. you\\u2019ll be ok.\\n\\n\\nyou can do this. \\\\> i didn\\u2019t think it would fuck me up like this. i just wanted to feel okay. to feel whole. to feel something different. cocaine gave me fake confidence, like everything was fine. sometimes i\\u2019m already high and i still think, \\u201ci can\\u2019t deal with this. i need more.\\u201d\\n\\nwhat confidence are you seeking? that is good to focus on without judgement.\\n\\n\\\\> sadness is constant in my life. but sometimes i can\\u2019t even cry. and other times i feel everything way too much. it\\u2019s exhausting. it\\u2019s chaos.\\n\\nnot able to cry sounds like fear. heavy emotion, but inability to put your guard down. feeling unsafe that unsuppressing what you feel might be too much than circumstances allow. \\n\\nsadness also comes from loss or something missing. what are you missing? needs unmet? passions unmet? healing unmet? focus on what you feel you wish you had and ask why you feel you\\u2019re missing that, as well as what steps can be made towards those. \\n\\ni heard some say about that habit long ago, if you can afford that vice, you can afford professional help. psychologist, psychiatrist. remember that.\\n\\n\\\\> i realized how deep i am when i can\\u2019t go one day without using, when i spend whole nights doing lines, when i can\\u2019t have sex unless i\\u2019m high. i know i\\u2019m addicted. i hate it. but i can\\u2019t stop.\\n\\ngo to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. there can be a multitude of things going on and can be addressed at different angles. if it\\u2019s more than one thing you may not be able to rightly divide what is what. if you\\u2019re struggling, let others whose whole jobs and decades of experience help you work through what those could be. no sense in feeling ashamed, no one will fault you for seeking help and wanting to improve yourself.\\n\\n\\\\> i need to get clean. i need to survive this withdrawal.\\n\\ndefinitely do what you feel your inner self is asking you to do, but also go to some medical professionals who can help you understand why you feel the way you do. i wasn\\u2019t aware there was any extended withdrawal with that, so it may be more psychological than anything.\\n\\n\\\\> i keep asking myself:\\n\\n\\\\> how do you deal with the emptiness when coke isn\\u2019t there?\\n\\nyou mentioned it is there even when it is there, so there\\u2019s something likely deeper going on. sometimes it\\u2019s simply pressures, lack of direction, or lack of passion or purpose.\\n\\n\\\\> how do you stop hating yourself for getting this far?\\n\\nlook at it as an opportunity to improve. nobody is perfect. we all make mistakes in life, but the good thing is noticing when you are unhappy and taking responsibility for change. questioning life decisions is a big part of life. it\\u2019s important to forgive yourself. \\n\\n\\\\> what the hell do you do when sobriety feels even worse?\\n\\nwhen you say even worse, what are you feeling in those moments? are you focusing on inadequacies or past mistakes? are you being hard on yourself for feeling like you are making poor decisions? is there unresolved emotional pain from past experiences you're trying to stop? find a passion. a hobby and pursue that. if it\\u2019s physical pain, sleep through it!\\n\\n\\\\> how do you build a self without the part that lived inside the drug?\\n\\nthink more about what you felt it was giving you, you wouldn\\u2019t have otherwise. then focus on improving that thing specifically. talk to psychologist. they\\u2019ll help identify what could be deeper. after that, or at the same time, talk to a psychiatrist. some things are beliefs, or programs, patterns, and some things can be more diet or hardware related. save a lot of time by investing in yourself to let others carry that weight to figure that out for you. what you spend on the vice, also spend on something healthy. maybe it\\u2019s twice the cost, but it cuts vice in half while working towards a long term solution. if you\\u2019re doing it every day, even drs once a week is a small part of that expense budget. \\n\\n\\\\> is it normal to want to quit and not want to at the same time?\\n\\nsure. smoking is unhealthy. you want to quit for reasons. are they yours or others? are they health related? is there any true benefit or are you avoiding pain? most addictions are about avoiding pain. forgetting loss. or filling something missing in your life. researching the scientific expectations of all of the psychological and/or physiological pain expected can help you mentally prepare what to expect so you don\\u2019t get overwhelmed it\\u2018s \\u201cgetting to be too much than i can handle overwhelmed.\\u201d you\\u2019ll know you\\u2019re 3/4 through and the last 1/4 is only 1/3 of what you\\u2019ve already experienced. knowing what to expect or that there is end in sight is half the battle. sleep as much as you can through that time period.\\n\\n\\\\> i don\\u2019t know if i\\u2019m looking for advice or just someone to tell me i\\u2019m not crazy. anything helps.\\n\\nthere\\u2018s nothing wrong with feeling crazy. we all go a little crazy sometimes. yes it's very normal to want to quit and yet not want to.   you want to 1- seek help from a substance abuse counselor.  not any old therapist, but someone actually trained in therapy for substance use.\\n    \\none activity i like for decisional balance is the 4way pro/con.\\n    \\ndraw a big + on a sheet of paper.   quadrant 1 is pros of quitting.   quad 2 is cons of quitting.   quad 3 is pros of using.   quad 4 is cons of using.  be honest about what you get from using, and why you don't want to quit.  because those are gonna be what you work on.  how can you get those benefits without using?  what can you do with your life, if you aren't stuck in addiction, that will fill the hole?  how can you take care of yourself so that the cons of quitting aren't so awful?  \\n    \\nthere is medication for withdrawal but it's less commonly used for coke.   coke is very psychological though, and withdrawal will give you basically a short term depression.  it will pass.   but it takes time.  like months.  a psychiatrist can evaluate you for medication to help with cravings, and a short term psych med to help the mood if you desire that. this is your brain on drugs, man. it took me a long time to kind of feel normal again after kicking that habit. it sucks big time but you can do it. wishing you the best of luck. gang idk sometimes i sit in the grass and it's nice you sound like every cokehead who's hit their limit and recognize the problem. i was habitual for the past 3 years, clearing a ball every weekend and on and off the the other 7 years. it's lost its magic for me. the money wasted, never getting good sleep, and the hindrance of personal relationships. best thing i did was to just stop buying it and going into sobriety knowing i need to find something to replace the urge to shove that  shit up my nose or be bored for a couple weeks until that urge is gone. hang in there, stay strong, and it will get better. embrace the withdrawal, make jokes about it, sleep a lot and give yourself time. that\\u2019s how i stopped using meth. went from a daily habit, to once every few weeks, and now it\\u2019s been months since the last time i smoked. you can do it, it\\u2019s just annoying. \\n\\nmy libido is slowly coming back, and i\\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that those mind-blowing orgasms probably won\\u2019t happen again without smoking. my motivation is still *tiny* but i feel like it\\u2019s growing, i can feel myself finally coming out of my slump. most people who abuse stimulants are undiagnosed adhd. i\\u2019m not saying you are but i\\u2019d try and be evaluated for it. self guilt and negative self talk / emotions are common with adhd folk. \\n\\ngo to therapy and find a new hobby you\\u2019re proud of. no one can really help you if you don\\u2019t want to actually change. it rests with you. i'm gonna drop into those conversations once a little bit of science, not so fun fact, cocaine steels, all of your dopamine, when you're coming down. you, your brain actually pushes out all of the dopamine serotone, and all those good feeling chemicals that our brain creates while you're high, and then when you come out you know, you're depleted, you absolutely have nothing left. and i hate to say this, because i hate to admit it, but i have done cocaine, and every time i did it, i felt like garbage, emotionally, physically just completely down-and-out. depressed, like i can't function. and uh to this day, i started using it when i was 17, and i'm definitely well beyond middle age, and i used it intermittently, but if i think about it, i still salivate, like it's bad. addictive, my body just wanted, and i never did it daily. i only ever did it like at parties. and with they're friends. you gotta stop it, man, cause it's, it's gonna kill you. if you don't, i've, i've lost friends, i'm sure you know that, and maybe just understanding the science behind it, that it's just a matter of regulating your body for a certain period of time. and once you've done that, you could also maybe go on some antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication to help you. there's things to do, but i don't think they'll give them to you while you're still addicted to cocaine. so you gotta get yourself a little bit sober and then you can help yourself out. then it's gonna f****** suck. just like you say, it's gonna suck for a while. but i promise you the other side, it's so much better. i have an addictive personality in i know. i know it's so much better. on the other side, i promise you, you just gotta hang in there day-by-day minute by minute hour by hour. you have to really want to live and living isn't how you feel when you're coming down from addiction, you'll have good moments. that you won't get to have when you're coming down. so don't expect it to be like that. and you probably have some therapy to do, you probably have some s*** to work through, because for as long as you've been doing the cocaine, you've been ignoring real life. and so you've got to catch up on you know the work that you should have been doing in that time that your brain was checking out. i wish you all the best. i'm positive you got this! there's aa groups for this called na. aa really helped my dad, i know they have a bad rap but they do help people get sober. please don't feel ashamed and consider reaching out to your local na group change the environment brother. environmental change will help. look up a nearby moderate hike to a mountain lake if possible and get out on the trail.  jump in that lake when you get there and let the cold water remind you that you are alive and you don\\u2019t need blow to be happy.  nature heals dude, also exercise it\\u2019s normal yet not but is and can\\u2019t be. \\n\\nthe emptiness only goes away or can be handled with faith. \\n\\nyou are the one that wants to but the voice from \\u201caddiction\\u201d which is his name - it\\u2019s that other one that is being confused as your feelings or your inner thoughts. \\n\\nso\\u2026.. your \\u201cmind\\u201d that produces what we call thoughts, comes form many layers of places and speaks many perspectives in either a single voice as you, or many others. \\n\\nthe reason i say this is because once i found out that thoughts aren\\u2019t from you it was easy to break addiction. my realization was, i\\u2019m not in a battle against myself, it\\u2019s not even human. \\n\\nsobriety feels worse? no that is only the \\u201cextras\\u201d being in control of your body. \\n\\nwait what? did this guy just say that thoughts don\\u2019t come from ourselves and not from a single source and not all are form humans and not all are form live creatures? \\n\\nnuts right?

time to sober up. my insurance wouldn\\u2019t cover my drug of choice. pretty sure coke is going to generate better support, but please seek out that support. it\\u2019s important. you are not crazy. you're hurting. and you're in the thick of it. but the fact that you are asking these questions means that you want to stop. take it one day at a time. and get a support system in place to help you until you are stronger and able to move past the cravings. try clarior mind, it takes time to reach neutral clarity are you feeling alone op? do you have strong people around you to lean on when you feel the need to use? is there something else that used to make you happy ? pay 20 bucks a month for chatgpt and talk with it.  it'll guide you through any addiction.  tell it exactly what's going on at any point in time in a single conversation thread use text don't talk to it. i promise it will get better and easier with time away from it. accept that you put yourself in this situation and do whatever you can to get out of it. there will be hard times but it will only get worse with further use. more anxiety, depression, dependency, and health complications. try cbt and dbt therapies. they helped sort myself out and i use them daily. depending on where you go, you may be able to find an ibogaine clinic. ibogaine isn't legal everywhere but there are clinics you can find in the us or in mexico. it's a psychedelic that resets the system triggering the physical aspect of the addiction. you'd still need support for the emotional/mental reasons. not to sound like an ambassador for psychedelics, but ketamine has shown really promising results for depression and shifting the way you think about past hurts. joyous, if available in your state, can ship it to your house for at-home treatments (you take the lozenge, then meditate or listen to a guided visualization or revisit old traumas).   \\nall that said, i second that you should seek professional support. and you should definitely be proud of yourself for being ready to change. good luck! you need to set yourself goals that mean more then sniffing coke all day. are you healthy and in shape? are you confident in your sober body? find new hobbies to bring excitement and joy back into your life. you don't need drugs to feel happy and confident  or feel something different. you can find all these things through experiencing life itself and being adventurous. get healthy, hit the gym, learn to love yourself without the mask of these drugs. i am now 2 years sober from coke and this is what i done. i was disgusted in my behaviour and who i was when i was on coke. it started off ok, and just a small habit i would engage in when i was out drinking with friends, then it turned me into a disgusting mess always wanting more, paranoid, addicted to sex and other disgusting behaviour which was enough for me to one day realise and quite cold turkey, because becoming a better me meant more! ask for help.  be honest with those that love you.  beg them to help keep you accountable.  give yourself a week...not alone...with no work...where you can physically detox.  honestly cocaine detox is about the easiest physical detox there is.  (speakjng as a long term addict of multiple substances)... but the mental dependence and the habit forming behavior and ritual behind use can still be a tricky thing to shake... but then...fill your time with positive things.  time with friends.  the gym.  positive hobbies.  and cut off all your drug friends.  \\n\\ndoing this alone is horrible....if you're truly ready for a change...its time to be honest with those in your life that can help you...and ask for that help. my brother died of a brain hemorrhage from cocaine use, he was 49. let that sink in you may need medical assistance? whatever you do, don\\u2019t try heroin just stop. look into islam i tried to get clean dozens of times from uppers, and i only finally achieved it with help from a 30-day rehab and then long-term outpatient treatment. i've been going to treatment ever since i got clean more than 2 years ago. appointments and/or groups were multiple times a week at first, but now i only go once a month. \\n\\nrecovery is so possible, i used to be a really fucked up individual. eventually, i found a reason to stay clean that was bigger than just me, and i got professional help. that's it. that's all i did. i wish you the best of luck, op. \\ud83e\\udec2 i agree i think that op bottled up their emotions too much and instead of feeling them out and crying it out, they retreat to a distraction, or something to make them forget. by doing that our body feels horrible cause you never allow it to fully process those feelings. but i know it\\u2019s hard to to face them when they creep up on us. it\\u2019s a fairly simple thing to do buts it\\u2019s not easy at all. \\n\\nin these times u need people around u. i say op needs to seek a therapist, a community, that will be there for them and cheer him up. i\\u2019d say start with a therapist.\",\n          \"reminders to all participants:\\n\\n- **use caution: there are con artists, scammers and sexual predators on reddit.  this is not a

relating to mental illness is \\\"mental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\\\" perhaps something to ponder as you navigate next steps. i want to begin by saying how sorry i am for what you\\u2019re going through. i know how hard it can be to make progress when it comes to your own mental health, but to then need to be aware of someone else\\u2019s constantly? sounds exhausting. \\n\\ni haven\\u2019t dealt with this with a partner, but i did want to share an experience i had with my ocd group. so, when i began group therapy i was, for lack of a better term, a mess. i laid in bed all day, only getting up to go to the bathroom twice and eat once per day because the compulsions surrounding both took hours. when i started group i immediately formed an attachment to these folks who knew exactly what i was going through. for about a year and a half we all chatted constantly and i felt so insanely connected to these people. but then. i started getting better. i was doing super difficult exposures and becoming more aware of myself. as i progressed i realized that i was only connected to these people via my ocd. i eventually got to where i am now, i have a job, i can take care of myself, i can do normal every day rhings without being overloaded with compulsions. but so many people from that group have not made that kind of progress, whether by choice or not. and eventually i realized i was just at a different place than them. it didn\\u2019t mean i didn\\u2019t love and care for these people who had supported me and given me so much advice, but it was just draining me to keep in contact with them. i always felt pressured to go to group therapy even though i really felt i didn\\u2019t need it anymore, i felt that my ocd would spike when i would catch up on chat messages because they talked about it all the time, i felt bad for my progress when i shared a win etc. so i eventually just kind of separated myself from them and it was the best thing i\\u2019ve ever done for me and my mental health. no matter the course you take i am sending you the best vibes. suffering in silence only passes the buck to a later you. unfortunately, if he\\u2019s not going to change, you need to decide if you\\u2019re willing to deal with it for the rest of your life because he straight up told you that he would understand if you left indicating that he really won\\u2019t change. or you leave him because you can\\u2019t deal with it. are you willing to lose him because you can\\u2019t handle him anymore or are you willing to keep living the way you are except understanding that you stayed so you know what you\\u2019re signing up for? it\\u2019s going to be a tough decision regardless. you two could go to couple\\u2019s therapy since it seems like both of you are open to therapy. in any case, i hope things work out for you. it\\u2019s clear he doesn\\u2019t want to change, he\\u2019s even willing to let you leave instead of getting help and changing his ways. try another conversation asking him to get help, and if it doesn\\u2019t work i think you have to leave. you\\u2019ll start to resent him, i went through something similar. my boyfriend has depression and he wasn\\u2019t taking his medication on purpose and not improving with therapy. i texted him asking if he wanted to get better. he was honest and said no, he asked if it was affecting me and told him it was. he\\u2019s been trying to heal now. when he wasn\\u2019t trying to heal it really brought be down and resented him, it felt like he was bringing me down with him. it sounds like your options are leave him, go down with him, or try another conversation. the most healthy option would be leaving, you can\\u2019t help someone who doesn\\u2019t want to be helped, they have to want it themselves. of course i don\\u2019t fully know your situation but the fact that he\\u2019s more okay with you leaving than getting some help or going to therapy is a pretty big red flag\\n\\ni know how debilitating ocd can be, i\\u2019m also in a relationship where my ocd is affecting me and my partners relationship, but it\\u2019s because i love them that i went to a psychiatrist and i\\u2019m starting therapy soon and willing to try to work on it\\n\\nedit: grammar, wording as someone who deeply relates! i have ocd and asperger\\u2019s too, i want to offer a bit of perspective.\\n\\nwhat brings him peace is probably creating distance from the things that trigger his anxiety. that\\u2019s why he does so much alone. i do the same, it\\u2019s not about pushing anyone away, it\\u2019s about keeping my world manageable and predictable.\\n\\nbut i completely understand how, for you, that distance can feel like emotional abandonment. my wife felt the same way.\\n\\nwhat ended up helping us was building structure together. we created \\u201cmy days,\\u201d \\u201cher days,\\u201d and \\u201cour days.\\u201d\\n\\nmy days are for me to recharge, manage my routines, and have space without pressure.\\n\\nher days are hers to do what she needs without worrying about me.\\n\\nour days are intentional time together, whether that\\u2019s talking, doing something low-stress, or just being present with each other.\\n\\nthis system helped my ocd because it gave structure and predictability. but more importantly, it protected our relationship. it gave my wife the emotional connection she needed and gave me the space i needed to function.\\n\\nit\\u2019s not a perfect fix, but it created breathing room and mutual respect. it took for my wife to say exactly how she feels and how much it pained her for to work even harder at my exposure therapy and to speak to my doctor for upping my doses. i can\\u2019t imagine how hard this is for you. from the start i wanted to feel better once i found out i had ocd. make sure and tell him how you feel and don\\u2019t sugar coat it. maybe it will spark a fire under him i don\\u2019t really know if what i am about to type is directly relevant, or helpful admittedly, but i just want to echo some of the sentiments of the other commenters, as well as sharing some of my own experiences from the perspective of someone with ocd in a long-term relationship.\\n\\nfirstly, i\\u2019m sorry you\\u2019re in this situation, and it\\u2019s a lot to deal with.\\n\\nin terms of attitudes surrounding seeking change vs \\u201cthis is the way i am\\u201d\\u2026 unfortunately, for treatment to be successful, your partner will need to reach a point where the desire for change will be genuine.\\n\\ni\\u2019ve read quite a lot of work from psychologists, and the psychologist i\\u2019m currently under the care of essentially wrote something to the effect of \\u201cassessing why they want treatment at this moment cannot be understated; if they are here due to being pressured by relatives, adherence to treatment can often be less than ideal\\u201d.\\n\\ni resisted change for years because i was scared - terrified, even. i tried a few times, but i couldn\\u2019t commit to getting the sort of help i needed because i was afraid, and didn\\u2019t want to face it. \\n\\ni reached a point one day where i realised i couldn\\u2019t keep going the way i was anymore, and decided to see a psychologist, with the intention that i would throw myself at whatever they asked me to do 100%. i felt that i could no longer be alive with the way i felt, and something needed to change.\\n\\ngetting to this point took years, and it took me getting to the lowest place i have ever been mentally before something \\u201cclicked\\u201d i guess.\\n\\nunfortunately, the answer i would give for the \\u201cknowing when to stop fighting\\u201d isn\\u2019t particularly the nicest answer, so i\\u2019m going to try and frame it as gently as i can as it sounds like you\\u2019re dealing with a lot.\\n\\nlike a few of the other commenters have suggested, i would try talking to your husband about exactly how you feel, without sugar-coating it.\\n\\ni wouldn\\u2019t give him an ultimatum; i would see how they react. if they organically and genuinely move towards wanting to get help / change, and you feel you are able to, i would support them. if they push back, and double-down, it\\u2019s probably time to move on. you can\\u2019t save him if he refuses to be saved and you can\\u2019t let it drag you down too he should be on medication or in therapy or both. i use both. any chance he can just try meds? meds helped my cleaning ocd. therapy didn\\u2019t. zoloft specifically. but please note it needs to be a therapeutic dose. i\\u2019m seeing significant improvement at 150 mgs. \\n\\ncleaning ocd is weird because it\\u2019s acceptable in our society. walk in any cvs down the cleaning aisle and you can see how obsessed our society is with disinfecting and cleaning. it\\u2019s deeply important to many people to have a clean and sanitary home at all times- in fact, it\\u2019s a sign of being a functioning adult. my ocd latched on to that and i told myself my cleanliness was just part of my identity. but there was a point in my life when i was taking 8 showers a day. a point when i couldn\\u2019t go into my basement without fear of contamination. a point when every surface in my house needed to be sanitized before going to sleep. it\\u2019s extremely tiring and if left untreated it will get worse.     \\n\\nbut once i got on a therapeutic dose of zoloft my life started changing. for example i\\u2019m lying on my bed right now in my outside clothing. this would have literally been impossible for me a month ago. i also haven\\u2019t washed my sheets in almost *two weeks* which is literally insane progress. \\n\\nthere is hope for cleaning ocd! awful situation however living apart (but still being together) may be a work around? that way you both can  choose how to deal with your own struggles without being triggered/ being triggering? \\n\\ni really hope you find a solution as i understand as the person with ocd whilst my partner has no mental illness is it possible for you to live apart but still be together? this way he gets to do things at home his way and you won't have to deal with it. some couples do this and it works well for them. i am going through this and we need to set up a support group zoom call. my husband is howard hughes. we are going through 15 rolls of paper towels a week. \\n\\nit is the exercise rituals 3 hours a day.... panics about touching metal. dish soap constantly. obsessing over the trash man/mail/any bill that is due. \\n\\nplastic bags around the house, rerun episodes on tv, tracking business hours, traffic lights, birthdays, sports betting, and controlling every bank.\\n\\nhoarding millions of dollars away in banks and brokerage accounts, planning out schedules. \\n\\nobsessing over our daughter for endless hours.  complete codependent crazy town. he hovers over her constantly. this is setting her up for a dysfunctional marriage.\\n\\nconstant hand washing. avoiding extra romance. sleeping with blankets near the fire and needing to be 110 degrees to sleep. sweating like a sauna. i get no comfort in bed. \\n\\npulling out extention cords and appliances constantly.\\ntracking everything in the refrigerator.\\n\\ni am so burned out also. dm me hello! i dealt with this for a few years with my partner until he got bad enough that i sat down with him and insisted he try something, ideally medication for his situation. he was brave enough to try. so far, the medication fluloxitine has been greatly helpful to him, especially with contamination issues. best of luck, friend. you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home! i\\u2019m sorry this is weighing on you heavily. i don\\u2019t have much advise but just as your husband gets a certain comfort from the cleanliness and rituals, you deserve a certain comfort in existing within your own four walls, too. it\\u2019s your home and shouldn\\u2019t be a place that fills you with so much anxiety and dread. i hope you guys find a way to work through this <3 sometimes ocd feels like your identity because it wants to control and give you the sense that you control every aspect of your life, its about time that he will realise he's more than his diagnosis, hopefully he can come around to it, but also keep your boundaries and don't get dragged if he's unwilling to change, it does become manageable and it has a great number of people that can live a healthy and easy life with it, he just probably is unsure of who he is outside his disorder, it happens. i think you\\u2019re great for sticking by his side. maybe you should take him to the people who helped you and see what they can do for him. it seems he doesn\\u2019t want to change so try and show him how much better you feel having your ocd how it is now. if even after all of that he refuses to change, then i think he\\u2019d understand if you could be with him anymore. i\\u2019m curious. what kind of ocd does he have? just wanted to comment as i have ocd and often feel very sad for what i have and continue to put my husband through - i dream of another life where he has a care free wife allowing him to enjoy things to the fullest. my big one is also contamination and my husband does things like washing his hands after opening the front door/doing laundry/picking something off the floor/wiping packages - small stuff most people probably don't do but i ingrained it into the poor guy. does your husband seem to have any sympathy for you? why do you think he does not want to at least try to reduce his compulsions or the ones he needs you to also follow? i do think some folks with ocd get worse as they age, that may be playing a part (not impossible to recover from just takes more work). in any healthy dynamic it is a deal breaker if one partner is causing the other distress and refuses to stop or work to improve. is he willing to work on himself? maybe a temporary separation, while he gets help and you find yourself a little bit again? i went through this for verbatim except the autism part with my husband. see my last year's post. i no longer participate in his rituals, and he found a spiritual journey to pursue different rituals in, but he still does his cleaning rituals, mostly on his own now. i still adhere to some of his rules, but he knows i'm not happy with them, but i notice the less he stresses and i don't react the less he does clean and become very bad with cleaning all day. the calmer he is, the less it's triggered. meditation and affirmations work. he also got on a mushroom gummy called reshi and takes saffron gummies every day, which has calmed him down. i can message you pics of the exact supplements if you want. girll my partner has ocd, great and i love him but the main reason why i'm sticking is cause he's always trying to get better, do better, far from healed but he's putting in the effort for a good life, a future together and that means the world to me. i would not have stayed without this no matter how much i love him. but i feel you. i'm so sorry, it's not an easy place to be in, seeing your partner struggle is a different kind of pain. i truly wish he decides to get help and learn to manage without engaging in his compulsions, if he doesn't, i'd advise you to leave. maybe you leaving would be a wake up call but don't count on it. i'd say that you need to see at least a belief and an attempt at changing. no matter if it fails. but it's very hard live with a loved person and see them spiraling down, see them cowardly give up on themselves, merely out of fear of facing such an annoying condition.  it's not like it's a seven headed dragon or something like that.\\n\\nwhich is what my (ex?) girlfriend does.  avoids facing it, avoids talking about it, gets angry if anyone mentions it.  endless compulsions.  every day i think i should leave. i feel a lot like your husband sometimes, like i\\u2019m incurable and stuck and i\\u2019m just like this. but my mindset changed when eventually my boyfriend just said \\u201cyou always tell me that nobody understands, and that you\\u2019re all alone, and that you\\u2019re gonna be like this forever, but you literally aren\\u2019t that unique. there\\u2019s no proof that you\\u2019re gonna be the first person in the world who can\\u2019t possibly get better\\u201d and it made me feel stupid at first but then i realized he was right i\\u2019m having a similar issue with my partner but not quite as bad i don\\u2019t think. there\\u2019s also other disability\\u2019s involved and trauma so kinda heavy. biggest issue is the same tho that they don\\u2019t think they can change. also they are so bad at communicating. i love them more than anything but i\\u2019m so emotionally exhausted. this is my perfect answer thanks \\u2665\\ufe0f\\n\\nwish you both the best and hope you fight this evil illness \\ud83d\\udcaa i am at an exactly same point where you were. this is so tiring and exhausting, but i was taking fluoxetine 60 mg and it did not help. maybe i will try zoloft. \\nhappy for you

are not crazy, addictions are hard but absolutely possible to get sober. people are afraid of emotions, but emotions can not kill us. emotions are there to give us messages. sadness, grief, anger, all of that has a purpose, we just have to stay with it to get the message. the fact that sometimes you can't cry tells me that perhaps you have a lot of emotions bottled up in your body. there are people who can help you process it all. unfortunately, drugs can't help with that. you have to let yourself feel things, process in a safe way. probably you have some trauma from young age to process. maybe listen to garbor mate, he has a lot of wisdom and compassion to offer. cocaine withdrawals aren't very physical but mental. you can do this just find something that you want more than the drug and start going to get the other things you need. one day at a time. don't worry about the day after, next week, and year from now, or a decade. just take it one day at a time. focus on just staying clean for today. when you think about the future and how you'll be clean next week, it gets extremely overwhelming and looks impossible, when one day is hard enough. just focus on staying clean for today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow i had to deal with other addictions. what worked for me was to quit cold turkey. at the start, it didn't work, i used to wake up in high spirits then relapse 10 hours later, other days i managed more hours than that, the key is to try everyday until one day you succeed. the more you try, the more you know what to expect and how to deal with it. what helped the most

wrote? that\\u2019s addiction. that\\u2019s what it does. it makes you feel empty and broken without it, like you can\\u2019t survive unless you\\u2019re high. but you\\u2019re not alone in this, and you're not the only one who's felt this way. i\\u2019ve been there. fully in it. and i promise you, there is another side. i made it out. it\\u2019s not easy. it\\u2019s messy and brutal, and it hurts like hell sometimes. but it absolutely gets better. withdrawal is hell. your brain lies to you. it tells you nothing will ever feel good again, that you\\u2019ll never be okay. but that\\u2019s not true. it just takes time for your system to reset. you\\u2019re not weak. your brain\\u2019s just been rewired, and it needs help to come back. wanting to quit and not quit at the same time is normal. it\\u2019s the most honest part of addiction. but the fact that you\\u2019re even asking these questions means something in you wants to live. that part is still in there. that part matters. you can\\u2019t do this on your own. you need support. i don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s a doctor, a detox center, a therapist, na, a support group, whatever you can get to. real help, from people who know what they\\u2019re doing. because this is too big to fight alone. and please stop beating yourself up. you didn\\u2019t ask for this. you\\u2019re not a bad person. you\\u2019re a human in pain, using what you had to survive. that\\u2019s not a weakness that\\u2019s survival. but now it\\u2019s time to come up for air. sobriety might feel empty and cold at first, yeah. the thing i hated the most was trying to not let my brain trick me. i had to separate myself from that concept that my brain and me are rhe same. in this context *they're not* the same *at all* as someone else mentioned, get help from real people who have been there. there's a lot of strange glamorized anecdotes out there and i found that they made me feel more isolated. find the ugly and the depraved. it's better to be prepared for all. but it\\u2019s only temporary. slowly, life starts to fill back in. you start to feel things again. you start to laugh without being high. you start to actually like yourself. i swear it happens. just not overnight. you\\u2019re still in there. you\\u2019re not your addiction. you\\u2019re not broken. you\\u2019re in the middle of a war, but you can win it. i know because i did. you don\\u2019t have to believe in yourself yet. i\\u2019ll believe in you for now. you\\u2019ve got this. one day at a time. even if all you do today is not use, that\\u2019s enough. that\\u2019s a win. keep going. i can't remember who it's from but a quote that helps me alot is that if the first step seems like too much, make it smaller. today. today i won't use. or, maybe even for the next 5 minutes. celebrate the small victories and nourish them to bigger ones. be kind when you fuck up, because you will. surround yourself with love and comfort and pretend during this process that you are dealing with your best friend in the whole world. how would you guide them? with love and patience and kindness every step of the way keep posting to find the inspirations, someone better versed in reddit can link the good subreddits i'm sure. \\u2661 as an ex addict (and forever addict) the only way is to go cold turkey and distant yourself from all that enables or gives/sells you coke or any alternatives. its hard, but its the only way that truly worked for me...( im a clean addict for the last 20 years) hi. you\\u2019re not crazy.. you\\u2019re dealing with something difficult. while i have partied a lot in my life.. maybe i\\u2019m one of the lucky ones who didn\\u2019t get into a full blown addiction. i\\u2019ve had friends tho that were highly addicted to cocaine and to stop you sometimes need to change your environment, stop spending time with people who do cocaine and just start fresh. i get that it\\u2019s easier said than done but if you take a long enough vacation from the substance you\\u2019ll notice you don\\u2019t need it to be happy or to give you confidence. it take time and effort and it\\u2019s good to have some support people who are sober and don\\u2019t trigger you. if anything, mini steps are better than nothing. i wish you the best and sorry it\\u2019s been hard. this world can be a traumadumpster and i feel you. reach out if you wanna chat more i needed a 90 day in patient rehab and then i lived at and managed a recovery house for a year and then i lived with a guy from the recovery house. it took a long time. i spent so many years running the game that i didn\\u2019t know what i thought was fun anymore. i hadn\\u2019t watched tv in five years at that point. i had to spend time and rediscover myself and who i was without the drugs. you aren't crazy, but coke is. get help. reddit can't do this for you. you take shrooms. i\\u2019ve never used cocaine. and yet i feel all the suffering you\\u2019re talking about. it\\u2019s all real every day suffering, without ever using. it\\u2019s part of being human. you just have to human long enough to kind of get used to it. then, when things get steady and quiet enough, you\\u2019ll be able to tune into small moments of novelty. and you\\u2019ll learn to grab those moments in just the right way, so they can be sustained for a little longer. you\\u2019ll learn to savor those moments in a way that they last, in a more poignant way than they ever could when you were tripping on the midst of a cocaine binge. and you\\u2019ll recognize that what you crave more than anything else, are the quiet boring novel moments that are worth waiting for. and you\\u2019ll make a practice of that, and it will be the most brilliant thing you\\u2019ve ever experienced, and you\\u2019ll decide you don\\u2019t want anything to ever get in the way of that seemingly small but infinite high. and you\\u2019ll be sustained by that level of sublime personal bliss, and never look back. this is not advice, but some people use less hard drugs as crutches. talk to your doctor delete the numbers in your phone connected to the connections. when it\\u2019s hard to attain the more undesirable it becomes get a therapist at least to discuss these feelings with, having someone to listen and analyze each question you raised without judgement is immensely beneficial. wanting and not wanting to quit is normal. remember the not is fear of everything you\\u2019ve been running from by using. the drug makes you feel safe, its how you cope. you will have to learn new ways to feel safe and cope with life. replacement behaviors. it\\u2019s possible but painful. you can get to the other side but ask for help. don\\u2019t do it alone. rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. there are such unfortunates. they are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. they are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. their chances are less than average. there are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. if you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it-then you are ready to take certain steps. at some of these we balked. we thought we could find an easier, softer way. but we could not. with all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. my friend, please check in to a detox at a rehab center. they have staff that manage your withdrawal symptoms etc. i've met so many fortunate folks at the rehab i attended who had complete turnaround. they have all those doctors, nurses and therapy staff on hand 24/7. obviously get help but that aside: -you\\u2019re not crazy. you\\u2019re fighting addiction of one of the most addictive and euphoric drugs. this wouldn\\u2019t be easy at all for anyone. -understand dopamine and find healthy highs. go for a walk, use sleep, eat properly, go on spa days. bordering on obsessive self care is the way forward here. -consider tapering slowly, ie reducing weekly intake in parts, skipping days and not binging on next consumption, -avoid environments where you are more likely to consume. this means friends who use, bars, parties or anywhere else. if your home is that, consider staying with a relative or a clean friend for a while. our environments are massive when it comes to breaking and maintaining behaviours -find good substitutes. drugs were taking up a lot of your time, and that time will not be easily passed if you don\\u2019t fill it with something. don\\u2019t expect it to be as euphoric as coke, but this can be helpful see a psychiatrist and then get into therapy. learn some coping mechanisms in therapy to deal with all this. medication may help with some of it, and the psychiatrist would be the one to see about that if not a regular doc may be able to help. i am substance use professional please feel free to dm and i can help you resource a bit if you want. coke withdrawal must be hard, but you already understand you are using it to avoid feeling and thinking about other stuff. the hardest thing is learning to simply accept everything you are feeling. to rest in it. to let it just be. it\\u2019s okay to feel empty and sad and emotions. it\\u2019s ok to feel bad about yourself. it will pass once you let it feel and process. when you are feeling those try journaling. or i dare say ask chatgpt to ask you questions to get to the root of your feelings. focus on the present moment. i mean, you may try to paint a picture of your feelings related to past events. focus on now though. what _now_ is getting you in this funk? focus on what you can control. accept the things you cannot control. i think meditation helps a lot for stuff like this too. the goal isn\\u2019t no thoughts. the goal isn\\u2019t no feelings. the goal is to just sit without distraction. let yourself feel and think whatever you feel or think. just let it happen. eventually you can move towards _noticing_ your breath and _noticing_ your thoughts. but for beginning just practice being ok with what you feel. last i seriously think self-hypnosis can help with all of this. the book \\u201cinstant self hypnosis\\u201d is good. you can use it to tackle how you are feeling. to tackle the addiction. to gain some control and confidence back. the process usually can last a few days. so redo it every few days. you don\\u2019t even have to quit coke. just take a break for a week or two. see where you get. most of all don\\u2019t avoid feeling like shit. just let it happen. you\\u2019ll be ok. you can do this. \\\\> i didn\\u2019t think it would fuck me up like this. i just wanted to feel okay. to feel whole. to feel something different. cocaine gave me fake confidence, like everything was fine. sometimes i\\u2019m already high and i still think, \\u201ci can\\u2019t deal with this. i need more.\\u201d what confidence are you seeking? that is good to focus on without judgement. \\\\> sadness is constant in my life. but sometimes i can\\u2019t even cry. and other times i feel everything way too much. it\\u2019s exhausting. it\\u2019s chaos. not able to cry sounds like fear. heavy emotion, but inability to put your guard down. feeling unsafe that unsuppressing what you feel might be too much than circumstances allow. sadness also comes from loss or something missing. what are you missing? needs unmet? passions unmet? healing unmet? focus on what you feel you wish you had and ask why you feel you\\u2019re missing that, as well as what steps can be made towards those. i heard some say about that habit long ago, if you can afford that vice, you can afford professional help. psychologist, psychiatrist. remember that. \\\\> i realized how deep i am when i can\\u2019t go one day without using, when i spend whole nights doing lines, when i can\\u2019t have sex unless i\\u2019m high. i know i\\u2019m addicted. i hate it. but i can\\u2019t stop. go to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. there can be a multitude of things going on and can be addressed at different angles. if it\\u2019s more than one thing you may not be able to rightly divide what is what. if you\\u2019re struggling, let others whose whole jobs and decades of experience help you work through what those could be. no sense in feeling ashamed, no one will fault you for seeking help and wanting to improve yourself. \\\\> i need to get clean. i need to survive this withdrawal. definitely do what you feel your inner self is asking you to do, but also go to some medical professionals who can help you understand why you feel the way you do. i wasn\\u2019t aware there was any extended withdrawal with that, so it may be more psychological than anything. \\\\> i keep asking myself: \\\\> how do you deal with the emptiness when coke isn\\u2019t there? you mentioned it is there even when it is there, so there\\u2019s something likely deeper going on. sometimes it\\u2019s simply pressures, lack of direction, or lack of passion or purpose. \\\\> how do you stop hating yourself for getting this far? look at it as an opportunity to improve. nobody is perfect. we all make mistakes in life, but the good thing is noticing when you are unhappy and taking responsibility for change. questioning life decisions is a big part of life. it\\u2019s important to forgive yourself. \\\\> what the hell do you do when sobriety feels even worse? when you say even worse, what are you feeling in those moments? are you focusing on inadequacies or past mistakes? are you being hard on yourself for feeling like you are making poor decisions? is there unresolved emotional pain from past experiences you're trying to stop? find a passion. a hobby and pursue that. if it\\u2019s physical pain, sleep through it! \\\\> how do you build a self without the part that lived inside the drug? think more about what you felt it was giving you, you wouldn\\u2019t have otherwise. then focus on improving that thing specifically. talk to psychologist. they\\u2019ll help identify what could be deeper. after that, or at the same time, talk to a psychiatrist. some things are beliefs, or programs, patterns, and some things can be more diet or hardware related. save a lot of time by investing in yourself to let others carry that weight to figure that out for you. what you spend on the vice, also spend on something healthy. maybe it\\u2019s twice the cost, but it cuts vice in half while working towards a long term solution. if you\\u2019re doing it every day, even drs once a week is a small part of that expense budget. \\\\> is it normal to want to quit and not want to at the same time? sure. smoking is unhealthy. you want to quit for reasons. are they yours or others? are they health related? is there any true benefit or are you avoiding pain? most addictions are about avoiding pain. forgetting loss. or filling something missing in your life. researching the scientific expectations of all of the psychological and/or physiological pain expected can help you mentally prepare what to expect so you don\\u2019t get overwhelmed it\\u2018s \\u201cgetting to be too much than i can handle overwhelmed.\\u201d you\\u2019ll know you\\u2019re 3/4 through and the last 1/4 is only 1/3 of what you\\u2019ve already experienced. knowing what to expect or that there is end in sight is half the battle. sleep as much as you can through that time period. \\\\> i don\\u2019t know if i\\u2019m looking for advice or just someone to tell me i\\u2019m not crazy. anything helps. there\\u2018s nothing wrong with feeling crazy. we all go a little crazy sometimes. yes it's very normal to want to quit and yet not want to. you want to 1- seek help from a substance abuse counselor. not any old therapist, but someone actually trained in therapy for substance use. one activity i like for decisional balance is the 4way pro/con. draw a big + on a sheet of paper. quadrant 1 is pros of quitting. quad 2 is cons of quitting. quad 3 is pros of using. quad 4 is cons of using. be honest about what you get from using, and why you don't want to quit. because those are gonna be what you work on. how can you get those benefits without using? what can you do with your life, if you aren't stuck in addiction, that will fill the hole? how can you take care of yourself so that the cons of quitting aren't so awful? there is medication for withdrawal but it's less commonly used for coke. coke is very psychological though, and withdrawal will give you basically a short term depression. it will pass. but it takes time. like months. a psychiatrist can evaluate you for medication to help with cravings, and a short term psych med to help the mood if you desire that. this is your brain on drugs, man. it took me a long time to kind of feel normal again after kicking that habit. it sucks big time but you can do it. wishing you the best of luck. gang idk sometimes i sit in the grass and it's nice you sound like every cokehead who's hit their limit and recognize the problem. i was habitual for the past 3 years, clearing a ball every weekend and on and off the the other 7 years. it's lost its magic for me. the money wasted, never getting good sleep, and the hindrance of personal relationships. best thing i did was to just stop buying it and going into sobriety knowing i need to find something to replace the urge to shove that shit up my nose or be bored for a couple weeks until that urge is gone. hang in there, stay strong, and it will get better. embrace the withdrawal, make jokes about it, sleep a lot and give yourself time. that\\u2019s how i stopped using meth. went from a daily habit, to once every few weeks, and now it\\u2019s been months since the last time i smoked. you can do it, it\\u2019s just annoying. my libido is slowly coming back, and i\\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that those mind-blowing orgasms probably won\\u2019t happen again without smoking. my motivation is still *tiny* but i feel like it\\u2019s growing, i can feel myself finally coming out of my slump. most people who abuse stimulants are undiagnosed adhd. i\\u2019m not saying you are but i\\u2019d try and be evaluated for it. self guilt and negative self talk / emotions are common with adhd folk. go to therapy and find a new hobby you\\u2019re proud of. no one can really help you if you don\\u2019t want to actually change. it rests with you. i'm gonna drop into those conversations once a little bit of science, not so fun fact, cocaine steels, all of your dopamine, when you're coming down. you, your brain actually pushes out all of the dopamine serotone, and all those good feeling chemicals that our brain creates while you're high, and then when you come out you know, you're depleted, you absolutely have nothing left. and i hate to say this, because i hate to admit it, but i have done cocaine, and every time i did it, i felt like garbage, emotionally, physically just completely down-and-out. depressed, like i can't function. and uh to this day, i started using it when i was 17, and i'm definitely well beyond middle age, and i used it intermittently, but if i think about it, i still salivate, like it's bad. addictive, my body just wanted, and i never did it daily. i only ever did it like at parties. and with they're friends. you gotta stop it, man, cause it's, it's gonna kill you. if you don't, i've, i've lost friends, i'm sure you know that, and maybe just understanding the science behind it, that it's just a matter of regulating your body for a certain period of time. and once you've done that, you could also maybe go on some antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication to help you. there's things to do, but i don't think they'll give them to you while you're still addicted to cocaine. so you gotta get yourself a little bit sober and then you can help yourself out. then it's gonna f****** suck. just like you say, it's gonna suck for a while. but i promise you the other side, it's so much better. i have an addictive personality in i know. i know it's so much better. on the other side, i promise you, you just gotta hang in there day-by-day minute by minute hour by hour. you have to really want to live and living isn't how you feel when you're coming down from addiction, you'll have good moments. that you won't get to have when you're coming down. so don't expect it to be like that. and you probably have some therapy to do, you probably have some s*** to work through, because for as long as you've been doing the cocaine, you've been ignoring real life. and so you've got to catch up on you know the work that you should have been doing in that time that your brain was checking out. i wish you all the best. i'm positive you got this! there's aa groups for this called na. aa really helped my dad, i know they have a bad rap but they do help people get sober. please don't feel ashamed and consider reaching out to your local na group change the environment brother. environmental change will help. look up a nearby moderate hike to a mountain lake if possible and get out on the trail. jump in that lake when you get there and let the cold water remind you that you are alive and you don\\u2019t need blow to be happy. nature heals dude, also exercise it\\u2019s normal yet not but is and can\\u2019t be. the emptiness only goes away or can be handled with faith. you are the one that wants to but the voice from \\u201caddiction\\u201d which is his name - it\\u2019s that other one that is being confused as your feelings or your inner thoughts. so\\u2026.. your \\u201cmind\\u201d that produces what we call thoughts, comes form many layers of places and speaks many perspectives in either a single voice as you, or many others. the reason i say this is because once i found out that thoughts aren\\u2019t from you it was easy to break addiction. my realization was, i\\u2019m not in a battle against myself, it\\u2019s not even human. sobriety feels worse? no that is only the \\u201cextras\\u201d being in control of your body. wait what? did this guy just say that thoughts don\\u2019t come from ourselves and not from a single source and not all are form humans and not all are form live creatures? nuts right? look into: integrated information theory (iit) - giulio tononi orchestrated objective reduction (orch-or) morphic resonance primacy of consciousness (quantum monism) panpsychism break contact with your friends who you do blow with or associate blow with. delete the numbers. block them. whatever it takes psilocybin i had to commit myself to get some time to sober up. my insurance wouldn\\u2019t cover my drug of choice. pretty sure coke is going to generate better support, but please seek out that support. it\\u2019s important. you are not crazy. you're hurting. and you're in the thick of it. but the fact that you are asking these questions means that you want to stop. take it one day at a time. and get a support system in place to help you until you are stronger and able to move past the cravings. try clarior mind, it takes time to reach neutral clarity are you feeling alone op? do you have strong people around you to lean on when you feel the need to use? is there something else that used to make you happy ? pay 20 bucks a month for chatgpt and talk with it. it'll guide you through any addiction. tell it exactly what's going on at any point in time in a single conversation thread use text don't talk to it. i promise it will get better and easier with time away from it. accept that you put yourself in this situation and do whatever you can to get out of it. there will be hard times but it will only get worse with further use. more anxiety, depression, dependency, and health complications. try cbt and dbt therapies. they helped sort myself out and i use them daily. depending on where you go, you may be able to find an ibogaine clinic. ibogaine isn't legal everywhere but there are clinics you can find in the us or in mexico. it's a psychedelic that resets the system triggering the physical aspect of the addiction. you'd still need support for the emotional/mental reasons. not to sound like an ambassador for psychedelics, but ketamine has shown really promising results for depression and shifting the way you think about past hurts. joyous, if available in your state, can ship it to your house for at-home treatments (you take the lozenge, then meditate or listen to a guided visualization or revisit old traumas). all that said, i second that you should seek professional support. and you should definitely be proud of yourself for being ready to change. good luck! you need to set yourself goals that mean more then sniffing coke all day. are you healthy and in shape? are you confident in your sober body? find new hobbies to bring excitement and joy back into your life. you don't need drugs to feel happy and confident or feel something different. you can find all these things through experiencing life itself and being adventurous. get healthy, hit the gym, learn to love yourself without the mask of these drugs. i am now 2 years sober from coke and this is what i done. i was disgusted in my behaviour and who i was when i was on coke. it started off ok, and just a small habit i would engage in when i was out drinking with friends, then it turned me into a disgusting mess always wanting more, paranoid, addicted to sex and other disgusting behaviour which was enough for me to one day realise and quite cold turkey, because becoming a better me meant more! ask for help. be honest with those that love you. beg them to help keep you accountable. give yourself a week...not alone...with no work...where you can physically detox. honestly cocaine detox is about the easiest physical detox there is. (speakjng as a long term addict of multiple substances)... but the mental dependence and the habit forming behavior and ritual behind use can still be a tricky thing to shake... but then...fill your time with positive things. time with friends. the gym. positive hobbies. and cut off all your drug friends. doing this alone is horrible....if you're truly ready for a change...its time to be honest with those in your life that can help you...and ask for that help. my brother died of a brain hemorrhage from cocaine use, he was 49. let that sink in you may need medical assistance? whatever you do, don\\u2019t try heroin just stop. look into islam i tried to get clean dozens of times from uppers, and i only finally achieved it with help from a 30-day rehab and then long-term outpatient treatment. i've been going to treatment ever since i got clean more than 2 years ago. appointments and/or groups were multiple times a week at first, but now i only go once a month. recovery is so possible, i used to be a really fucked up individual. eventually, i found a reason to stay clean that was bigger than just me, and i got professional help. that's it. that's all i did. i wish you the best of luck, op. \\ud83e\\udec2 i agree i think that op bottled up their emotions too much and instead of feeling them out and crying it out, they retreat to a distraction, or something to make them forget. by doing that our body feels horrible cause you never allow it to fully process those feelings. but i know it\\u2019s hard to to face them when they creep up on us. it\\u2019s a fairly simple thing to do buts it\\u2019s not easy at all. in these times u need people around u. i say op needs to seek a therapist, a community, that will be there for them and cheer him up. i\\u2019d say start with a therapist.\",\n          \"reminders to all participants: - **use caution: there are con artists, scammers and sexual predators on reddit. this is not a controlled environment.** - as such,

a half we all chatted constantly and i felt so insanely connected to these people. but then. i started getting better. i was doing super difficult exposures and becoming more aware of myself. as i progressed i realized that i was only connected to these people via my ocd. i eventually got to where i am now, i have a job, i can take care of myself, i can do normal every day rhings without being overloaded with compulsions. but so many people from that group have not made that kind of progress, whether by choice or not. and eventually i realized i was just at a different place than them. it didn\\u2019t mean i didn\\u2019t love and care for these people who had supported me and given me so much advice, but it was just draining me to keep in contact with them. i always felt pressured to go to group therapy even though i really felt i didn\\u2019t need it anymore, i felt that my ocd would spike when i would catch up on chat messages because they talked about it all the time, i felt bad for my progress when i shared a win etc. so i eventually just kind of separated myself from them and it was the best thing i\\u2019ve ever done for me and my mental health. no matter the course you take i am sending you the best vibes. suffering in silence only passes the buck to a later you. unfortunately, if he\\u2019s not going to change, you need to decide if you\\u2019re willing to deal with it for the rest of your life because he straight up told you that he would understand if you left indicating that he really won\\u2019t change. or you leave him because you can\\u2019t deal with it. are you willing to lose him because you can\\u2019t handle him anymore or are you willing to keep living the way you are except understanding that you stayed so you know what you\\u2019re signing up for? it\\u2019s going to be a tough decision regardless. you two could go to couple\\u2019s therapy since it seems like both of you are open to therapy. in any case, i hope things work out for you. it\\u2019s clear he doesn\\u2019t want to change, he\\u2019s even willing to let you leave instead of getting help and changing his ways. try another conversation asking him to get help, and if it doesn\\u2019t work i think you have to leave. you\\u2019ll start to resent him, i went through something similar. my boyfriend has depression and he wasn\\u2019t taking his medication on purpose and not improving with therapy. i texted him asking if he wanted to get better. he was honest and said no, he asked if it was affecting me and told him it was. he\\u2019s been trying to heal now. when he wasn\\u2019t trying to heal it really brought be down and resented him, it felt like he was bringing me down with him. it sounds like your options are leave him, go down with him, or try another conversation. the most healthy option would be leaving, you can\\u2019t help someone who doesn\\u2019t want to be helped, they have to want it themselves. of course i don\\u2019t fully know your situation but the fact that he\\u2019s more okay with you leaving than getting some help or going to therapy is a pretty big red flag i know how debilitating ocd can be, i\\u2019m also in a relationship where my ocd is affecting me and my partners relationship, but it\\u2019s because i love them that i went to a psychiatrist and i\\u2019m starting therapy soon and willing to try to work on it edit: grammar, wording as someone who deeply relates! i have ocd and asperger\\u2019s too, i want to offer a bit of perspective. what brings him peace is probably creating distance from the things that trigger his anxiety. that\\u2019s why he does so much alone. i do the same, it\\u2019s not about pushing anyone away, it\\u2019s about keeping my world manageable and predictable. but i completely understand how, for you, that distance can feel like emotional abandonment. my wife felt the same way. what ended up helping us was building structure together. we created \\u201cmy days,\\u201d \\u201cher days,\\u201d and \\u201cour days.\\u201d my days are for me to recharge, manage my routines, and have space without pressure. her days are hers to do what she needs without worrying about me. our days are intentional time together, whether that\\u2019s talking, doing something low-stress, or just being present with each other. this system helped my ocd because it gave structure and predictability. but more importantly, it protected our relationship. it gave my wife the emotional connection she needed and gave me the space i needed to function. it\\u2019s not a perfect fix, but it created breathing room and mutual respect. it took for my wife to say exactly how she feels and how much it pained her for to work even harder at my exposure therapy and to speak to my doctor for upping my doses. i can\\u2019t imagine how hard this is for you. from the start i wanted to feel better once i found out i had ocd. make sure and tell him how you feel and don\\u2019t sugar coat it. maybe it will spark a fire under him i don\\u2019t really know if what i am about to type is directly relevant, or helpful admittedly, but i just want to echo some of the sentiments of the other commenters, as well as sharing some of my own experiences from the perspective of someone with ocd in a long-term relationship. firstly, i\\u2019m sorry you\\u2019re in this situation, and it\\u2019s a lot to deal with. in terms of attitudes surrounding seeking change vs \\u201cthis is the way i am\\u201d\\u2026 unfortunately, for treatment to be successful, your partner will need to reach a point where the desire for change will be genuine. i\\u2019ve read quite a lot of work from psychologists, and the psychologist i\\u2019m currently under the care of essentially wrote something to the effect of \\u201cassessing why they want treatment at this moment cannot be understated; if they are here due to being pressured by relatives, adherence to treatment can often be less than ideal\\u201d. i resisted change for years because i was scared - terrified, even. i tried a few times, but i couldn\\u2019t commit to getting the sort of help i needed because i was afraid, and didn\\u2019t want to face it. i reached a point one day where i realised i couldn\\u2019t keep going the way i was anymore, and decided to see a psychologist, with the intention that i would throw myself at whatever they asked me to do 100%. i felt that i could no longer be alive with the way i felt, and something needed to change. getting to this point took years, and it took me getting to the lowest place i have ever been mentally before something \\u201cclicked\\u201d i guess. unfortunately, the answer i would give for the \\u201cknowing when to stop fighting\\u201d isn\\u2019t particularly the nicest answer, so i\\u2019m going to try and frame it as gently as i can as it sounds like you\\u2019re dealing with a lot. like a few of the other commenters have suggested, i would try talking to your husband about exactly how you feel, without sugar-coating it. i wouldn\\u2019t give him an ultimatum; i would see how they react. if they organically and genuinely move towards wanting to get help / change, and you feel you are able to, i would support them. if they push back, and double-down, it\\u2019s probably time to move on. you can\\u2019t save him if he refuses to be saved and you can\\u2019t let it drag you down too he should be on medication or in therapy or both. i use both. any chance he can just try meds? meds helped my cleaning ocd. therapy didn\\u2019t. zoloft specifically. but please note it needs to be a therapeutic dose. i\\u2019m seeing significant improvement at 150 mgs. cleaning ocd is weird because it\\u2019s acceptable in our society. walk in any cvs down the cleaning aisle and you can see how obsessed our society is with disinfecting and cleaning. it\\u2019s deeply important to many people to have a clean and sanitary home at all times- in fact, it\\u2019s a sign of being a functioning adult. my ocd latched on to that and i told myself my cleanliness was just part of my identity. but there was a point in my life when i was taking 8 showers a day. a point when i couldn\\u2019t go into my basement without fear of contamination. a point when every surface in my house needed to be sanitized before going to sleep. it\\u2019s extremely tiring and if left untreated it will get worse. but once i got on a therapeutic dose of zoloft my life started changing. for example i\\u2019m lying on my bed right now in my outside clothing. this would have literally been impossible for me a month ago. i also haven\\u2019t washed my sheets in almost *two weeks* which is literally insane progress. there is hope for cleaning ocd! awful situation however living apart (but still being together) may be a work around? that way you both can choose how to deal with your own struggles without being triggered/ being triggering? i really hope you find a solution as i understand as the person with ocd whilst my partner has no mental illness is it possible for you to live apart but still be together? this way he gets to do things at home his way and you won't have to deal with it. some couples do this and it works well for them. i am going through this and we need to set up a support group zoom call. my husband is howard hughes. we are going through 15 rolls of paper towels a week. it is the exercise rituals 3 hours a day.... panics about touching metal. dish soap constantly. obsessing over the trash man/mail/any bill that is due. plastic bags around the house, rerun episodes on tv, tracking business hours, traffic lights, birthdays, sports betting, and controlling every bank. hoarding millions of dollars away in banks and brokerage accounts, planning out schedules. obsessing over our daughter for endless hours. complete codependent crazy town. he hovers over her constantly. this is setting her up for a dysfunctional marriage. constant hand washing. avoiding extra romance. sleeping with blankets near the fire and needing to be 110 degrees to sleep. sweating like a sauna. i get no comfort in bed. pulling out extention cords and appliances constantly. tracking everything in the refrigerator. i am so burned out also. dm me hello! i dealt with this for a few years with my partner until he got bad enough that i sat down with him and insisted he try something, ideally medication for his situation. he was brave enough to try. so far, the medication fluloxitine has been greatly helpful to him, especially with contamination issues. best of luck, friend. you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home! i\\u2019m sorry this is weighing on you heavily. i don\\u2019t have much advise but just as your husband gets a certain comfort from the cleanliness and rituals, you deserve a certain comfort in existing within your own four walls, too. it\\u2019s your home and shouldn\\u2019t be a place that fills you with so much anxiety and dread. i hope you guys find a way to work through this <3 sometimes ocd feels like your identity because it wants to control and give you the sense that you control every aspect of your life, its about time that he will realise he's more than his diagnosis, hopefully he can come around to it, but also keep your boundaries and don't get dragged if he's unwilling to change, it does become manageable and it has a great number of people that can live a healthy and easy life with it, he just probably is unsure of who he is outside his disorder, it happens. i think you\\u2019re great for sticking by his side. maybe you should take him to the people who helped you and see what they can do for him. it seems he doesn\\u2019t want to change so try and show him how much better you feel having your ocd how it is now. if even after all of that he refuses to change, then i think he\\u2019d understand if you could be with him anymore. i\\u2019m curious. what kind of ocd does he have? just wanted to comment as i have ocd and often feel very sad for what i have and continue to put my husband through - i dream of another life where he has a care free wife allowing him to enjoy things to the fullest. my big one is also contamination and my husband does things like washing his hands after opening the front door/doing laundry/picking something off the floor/wiping packages - small stuff most people probably don't do but i ingrained it into the poor guy. does your husband seem to have any sympathy for you? why do you think he does not want to at least try to reduce his compulsions or the ones he needs you to also follow? i do think some folks with ocd get worse as they age, that may be playing a part (not impossible to recover from just takes more work). in any healthy dynamic it is a deal breaker if one partner is causing the other distress and refuses to stop or work to improve. is he willing to work on himself? maybe a temporary separation, while he gets help and you find yourself a little bit again? i went through this for verbatim except the autism part with my husband. see my last year's post. i no longer participate in his rituals, and he found a spiritual journey to pursue different rituals in, but he still does his cleaning rituals, mostly on his own now. i still adhere to some of his rules, but he knows i'm not happy with them, but i notice the less he stresses and i don't react the less he does clean and become very bad with cleaning all day. the calmer he is, the less it's triggered. meditation and affirmations work. he also got on a mushroom gummy called reshi and takes saffron gummies every day, which has calmed him down. i can message you pics of the exact supplements if you want. girll my partner has ocd, great and i love him but the main reason why i'm sticking is cause he's always trying to get better, do better, far from healed but he's putting in the effort for a good life, a future together and that means the world to me. i would not have stayed without this no matter how much i love him. but i feel you. i'm so sorry, it's not an easy place to be in, seeing your partner struggle is a different kind of pain. i truly wish he decides to get help and learn to manage without engaging in his compulsions, if he doesn't, i'd advise you to leave. maybe you leaving would be a wake up call but don't count on it. i'd say that you need to see at least a belief and an attempt at changing. no matter if it fails. but it's very hard live with a loved person and see them spiraling down, see them cowardly give up on themselves, merely out of fear of facing such an annoying condition. it's not like it's a seven headed dragon or something like that. which is what my (ex?) girlfriend does. avoids facing it, avoids talking about it, gets angry if anyone mentions it. endless compulsions. every day i think i should leave. i feel a lot like your husband sometimes, like i\\u2019m incurable and stuck and i\\u2019m just like this. but my mindset changed when eventually my boyfriend just said \\u201cyou always tell me that nobody understands, and that you\\u2019re all alone, and that you\\u2019re gonna be like this forever, but you literally aren\\u2019t that unique. there\\u2019s no proof that you\\u2019re gonna be the first person in the world who can\\u2019t possibly get better\\u201d and it made me feel stupid at first but then i realized he was right i\\u2019m having a similar issue with my partner but not quite as bad i don\\u2019t think. there\\u2019s also other disability\\u2019s involved and trauma so kinda heavy. biggest issue is the same tho that they don\\u2019t think they can change. also they are so bad at communicating. i love them more than anything but i\\u2019m so emotionally exhausted. this is my perfect answer thanks \\u2665\\ufe0f wish you both the best and hope you fight this evil illness \\ud83d\\udcaa i am at an exactly same point where you were. this is so tiring and exhausting, but i was taking fluoxetine 60 mg and it did not help. maybe i will try zoloft. happy for you though, i know how tough it is.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n

to feel okay. to feel whole. to feel something different. cocaine gave me fake confidence, like everything was fine. sometimes i\\u2019m already high and i still think, \\u201ci can\\u2019t deal with this. i need more.\\u201d sadness is constant in my life. but sometimes i can\\u2019t even cry. and other times i feel everything way too much. it\\u2019s exhausting. it\\u2019s chaos. i realized how deep i am when i can\\u2019t go one day without using, when i spend whole nights doing lines, when i can\\u2019t have sex unless i\\u2019m high. i know i\\u2019m addicted. i hate it. but i can\\u2019t stop. i need to get clean. i need to survive this withdrawal. i keep asking myself: how do you deal with the emptiness when coke isn\\u2019t there? how do you stop hating yourself for getting this far? what the hell do you do when sobriety feels even worse? how do you build a self without the part that lived inside the drug? is it normal to want to quit and not want to at the same time? i don\\u2019t know if i\\u2019m looking for advice or just someone to tell me i\\u2019m not crazy. anything helps. get help. from real people. like qualified medical doctor to help with withdrawal, therapy for mental health. you are not crazy, addictions are hard but absolutely possible to get sober. people are afraid of emotions, but emotions can not kill us. emotions are there to give us messages. sadness, grief, anger, all of that has a purpose, we just have to stay with it to get the message. the fact that sometimes you can't cry tells me that perhaps you have a lot of emotions bottled up in your body. there are people who can help you process it all. unfortunately, drugs can't help with that. you have to let yourself feel things, process in a safe way. probably you have some trauma from young age to process. maybe listen to garbor mate, he has a lot of wisdom and compassion to offer. cocaine withdrawals aren't very physical but mental. you can do this just find something that you want more than the drug and start going to get the other things you need. one day at a time. don't worry about the day after, next week, and year from now, or a decade. just take it one day at a time. focus on just staying clean for today. when you think about the future and how you'll be clean next week, it gets extremely overwhelming and looks impossible, when one day is hard enough. just focus on staying clean for today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow i had to deal with other addictions. what worked for me was to quit cold turkey. at the start, it didn't work, i used to wake up in high spirits then relapse 10 hours later, other days i managed more hours than that, the key is to try everyday until one day you succeed. the more you try, the more you know what to expect and how to deal with it. what helped the most was getting super busy and everytime i felt the urge, i did something intense like extremely long walks. it is hard but doable if you try. hey. first off, you\\u2019re not crazy. \\u2661 what you wrote? that\\u2019s addiction. that\\u2019s what it does. it makes you feel empty and broken without it, like you can\\u2019t survive unless you\\u2019re high. but you\\u2019re not alone in this, and you're not the only one who's felt this way. i\\u2019ve been there. fully in it. and i promise you, there is another side. i made it out. it\\u2019s not easy. it\\u2019s messy and brutal, and it hurts like hell sometimes. but it absolutely gets better. withdrawal is hell. your brain lies to you. it tells you nothing will ever feel good again, that you\\u2019ll never be okay. but that\\u2019s not true. it just takes time for your system to reset. you\\u2019re not weak. your brain\\u2019s just been rewired, and it needs help to come back. wanting to quit and not quit at the same time is normal. it\\u2019s the most honest part of addiction. but the fact that you\\u2019re even asking these questions means something in you wants to live. that part is still in there. that part matters. you can\\u2019t do this on your own. you need support. i don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s a doctor, a detox center, a therapist, na, a support group, whatever you can get to. real help, from people who know what they\\u2019re doing. because this is too big to fight alone. and please stop beating yourself up. you didn\\u2019t ask for this. you\\u2019re not a bad person. you\\u2019re a human in pain, using what you had to survive. that\\u2019s not a weakness that\\u2019s survival. but now it\\u2019s time to come up for air. sobriety might feel empty and cold at first, yeah. the thing i hated the most was trying to not let my brain trick me. i had to separate myself from that concept that my brain and me are rhe same. in this context *they're not* the same *at all* as someone else mentioned, get help from real people who have been there. there's a lot of strange glamorized anecdotes out there and i found that they made me feel more isolated. find the ugly and the depraved. it's better to be prepared for all. but it\\u2019s only temporary. slowly, life starts to fill back in. you start to feel things again. you start to laugh without being high. you start to actually like yourself. i swear it happens. just not overnight. you\\u2019re still in there. you\\u2019re not your addiction. you\\u2019re not broken. you\\u2019re in the middle of a war, but you can win it. i know because i did. you don\\u2019t have to believe in yourself yet. i\\u2019ll believe in you for now. you\\u2019ve got this. one day at a time. even if all you do today is not use, that\\u2019s enough. that\\u2019s a win. keep going. i can't remember who it's from but a quote that helps me alot is that if the first step seems like too much, make it smaller. today. today i won't use. or, maybe even for the next 5 minutes. celebrate the small victories and nourish them to bigger ones. be kind when you fuck up, because you will. surround yourself with love and comfort and pretend during this process that you are dealing with your best friend in the whole world. how would you guide them? with love and patience and kindness every step of the way keep posting to find the inspirations, someone better versed in reddit can link the good subreddits i'm sure. \\u2661 as an ex addict (and forever addict) the only way is to go cold turkey and distant yourself from all that enables or gives/sells you coke or any alternatives. its hard, but its the only way that truly worked for me...( im a clean addict for the last 20 years) hi. you\\u2019re not crazy.. you\\u2019re dealing with something difficult. while i have partied a lot in my life.. maybe i\\u2019m one of the lucky ones who didn\\u2019t get into a full blown addiction. i\\u2019ve had friends tho that were highly addicted to cocaine and to stop you sometimes need to change your environment, stop spending time with people who do cocaine and just start fresh. i get that it\\u2019s easier said than done but if you take a long enough vacation from the substance you\\u2019ll notice you don\\u2019t need it to be happy or to give you confidence. it take time and effort and it\\u2019s good to have some support people who are sober and don\\u2019t trigger you. if anything, mini steps are better than nothing. i wish you the best and sorry it\\u2019s been hard. this world can be a traumadumpster and i feel you. reach out if you wanna chat more i needed a 90 day in patient rehab and then i lived at and managed a recovery house for a year and then i lived with a guy from the recovery house. it took a long time. i spent so many years running the game that i didn\\u2019t know what i thought was fun anymore. i hadn\\u2019t watched tv in five years at that point. i had to spend time and rediscover myself and who i was without the drugs. you aren't crazy, but coke is. get help. reddit can't do this for you. you take shrooms. i\\u2019ve never used cocaine. and yet i feel all the suffering you\\u2019re talking about. it\\u2019s all real every day suffering, without ever using. it\\u2019s part of being human. you just have to human long enough to kind of get used to it. then, when things get steady and quiet enough, you\\u2019ll be able to tune into small moments of novelty. and you\\u2019ll learn to grab those moments in just the right way, so they can be sustained for a little longer. you\\u2019ll learn to savor those moments in a way that they last, in a more poignant way than they ever could when you were tripping on the midst of a cocaine binge. and you\\u2019ll recognize that what you crave more than anything else, are the quiet boring novel moments that are worth waiting for. and you\\u2019ll make a practice of that, and it will be the most brilliant thing you\\u2019ve ever experienced, and you\\u2019ll decide you don\\u2019t want anything to ever get in the way of that seemingly small but infinite high. and you\\u2019ll be sustained by that level of sublime personal bliss, and never look back. this is not advice, but some people use less hard drugs as crutches. talk to your doctor delete the numbers in your phone connected to the connections. when it\\u2019s hard to attain the more undesirable it becomes get a therapist at least to discuss these feelings with, having someone to listen and analyze each question you raised without judgement is immensely beneficial. wanting and not wanting to quit is normal. remember the not is fear of everything you\\u2019ve been running from by using. the drug makes you feel safe, its how you cope. you will have to learn new ways to feel safe and cope with life. replacement behaviors. it\\u2019s possible but painful. you can get to the other side but ask for help. don\\u2019t do it alone. rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. there are such unfortunates. they are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. they are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. their chances are less than average. there are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. if you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it-then you are ready to take certain steps. at some of these we balked. we thought we could find an easier, softer way. but we could not. with all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. my friend, please check in to a detox at a rehab center. they have staff that manage your withdrawal symptoms etc. i've met so many fortunate folks at the rehab i attended who had complete turnaround. they have all those doctors, nurses and therapy staff on hand 24/7. obviously get help but that aside: -you\\u2019re not crazy. you\\u2019re fighting addiction of one of the most addictive and euphoric drugs. this wouldn\\u2019t be easy at all for anyone. -understand dopamine and find healthy highs. go for a walk, use sleep, eat properly, go on spa days. bordering on obsessive self care is the way forward here. -consider tapering slowly, ie reducing weekly intake in parts, skipping days and not binging on next consumption, -avoid environments where you are more likely to consume. this means friends who use, bars, parties or anywhere else. if your home is that, consider staying with a relative or a clean friend for a while. our environments are massive when it comes to breaking and maintaining behaviours -find good substitutes. drugs were taking up a lot of your time, and that time will not be easily passed if you don\\u2019t fill it with something. don\\u2019t expect it to be as euphoric as coke, but this can be helpful see a psychiatrist and then get into therapy. learn some coping mechanisms in therapy to deal with all this. medication may help with some of it, and the psychiatrist would be the one to see about that if not a regular doc may be able to help. i am substance use professional please feel free to dm and i can help you resource a bit if you want. coke withdrawal must be hard, but you already understand you are using it to avoid feeling and thinking about other stuff. the hardest thing is learning to simply accept everything you are feeling. to rest in it. to let it just be. it\\u2019s okay to feel empty and sad and emotions. it\\u2019s ok to feel bad about yourself. it will pass once you let it feel and process. when you are feeling those try journaling. or i dare say ask chatgpt to ask you questions to get to the root of your feelings. focus on the present moment. i mean, you may try to paint a picture of your feelings related to past events. focus on now though. what _now_ is getting you in this funk? focus on what you can control. accept the things you cannot control. i think meditation helps a lot for stuff like this too. the goal isn\\u2019t no thoughts. the goal isn\\u2019t no feelings. the goal is to just sit without distraction. let yourself feel and think whatever you feel or think. just let it happen. eventually you can move towards _noticing_ your breath and _noticing_ your thoughts. but for beginning just practice being ok with what you feel. last i seriously think self-hypnosis can help with all of this. the book \\u201cinstant self hypnosis\\u201d is good. you can use it to tackle how you are feeling. to tackle the addiction. to gain some control and confidence back. the process usually can last a few days. so redo it every few days. you don\\u2019t even have to quit coke. just take a break for a week or two. see where you get. most of all don\\u2019t avoid feeling like shit. just let it happen. you\\u2019ll be ok. you can do this. \\\\> i didn\\u2019t think it would fuck me up like this. i just wanted to feel okay. to feel whole. to feel something different. cocaine gave me fake confidence, like everything was fine. sometimes i\\u2019m already high and i still think, \\u201ci can\\u2019t deal with this. i need more.\\u201d what confidence are you seeking? that is good to focus on without judgement. \\\\> sadness is constant in my life. but sometimes i can\\u2019t even cry. and other times i feel everything way too much. it\\u2019s exhausting. it\\u2019s chaos. not able to cry sounds like fear. heavy emotion, but inability to put your guard down. feeling unsafe that unsuppressing what you feel might be too much than circumstances allow. sadness also comes from loss or something missing. what are you missing? needs unmet? passions unmet? healing unmet? focus on what you feel you wish you had and ask why you feel you\\u2019re missing that, as well as what steps can be made towards those. i heard some say about that habit long ago, if you can afford that vice, you can afford professional help. psychologist, psychiatrist. remember that. \\\\> i realized how deep i am when i can\\u2019t go one day without using, when i spend whole nights doing lines, when i can\\u2019t have sex unless i\\u2019m high. i know i\\u2019m addicted. i hate it. but i can\\u2019t stop. go to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. there can be a multitude of things going on and can be addressed at different angles. if it\\u2019s more than one thing you may not be able to rightly divide what is what. if you\\u2019re struggling, let others whose whole jobs and decades of experience help you work through what those could be. no sense in feeling ashamed, no one will fault you for seeking help and wanting to improve yourself. \\\\> i need to get clean. i need to survive this withdrawal. definitely do what you feel your inner self is asking you to do, but also go to some medical professionals who can help you understand why you feel the way you do. i wasn\\u2019t aware there was any extended withdrawal with that, so it may be more psychological than anything. \\\\> i keep asking myself: \\\\> how do you deal with the emptiness when coke isn\\u2019t there? you mentioned it is there even when it is there, so there\\u2019s something likely deeper going on. sometimes it\\u2019s simply pressures, lack of direction, or lack of passion or purpose. \\\\> how do you stop hating yourself for getting this far? look at it as an opportunity to improve. nobody is perfect. we all make mistakes in life, but the good thing is noticing when you are unhappy and taking responsibility for change. questioning life decisions is a big part of life. it\\u2019s important to forgive yourself. \\\\> what the hell do you do when sobriety feels even worse? when you say even worse, what are you feeling in those moments? are you focusing on inadequacies or past mistakes? are you being hard on yourself for feeling like you are making poor decisions? is there unresolved emotional pain from past experiences you're trying to stop? find a passion. a hobby and pursue that. if it\\u2019s physical pain, sleep through it! \\\\> how do you build a self without the part that lived inside the drug? think more about what you felt it was giving you, you wouldn\\u2019t have otherwise. then focus on improving that thing specifically. talk to psychologist. they\\u2019ll help identify what could be deeper. after that, or at the same time, talk to a psychiatrist. some things are beliefs, or programs, patterns, and some things can be more diet or hardware related. save a lot of time by investing in yourself to let others carry that weight to figure that out for you. what you spend on the vice, also spend on something healthy. maybe it\\u2019s twice the cost, but it cuts vice in half while working towards a long term solution. if you\\u2019re doing it every day, even drs once a week is a small part of that expense budget. \\\\> is it normal to want to quit and not want to at the same time? sure. smoking is unhealthy. you want to quit for reasons. are they yours or others? are they health related? is there any true benefit or are you avoiding pain? most addictions are about avoiding pain. forgetting loss. or filling something missing in your life. researching the scientific expectations of all of the psychological and/or physiological pain expected can help you mentally prepare what to expect so you don\\u2019t get overwhelmed it\\u2018s \\u201cgetting to be too much than i can handle overwhelmed.\\u201d you\\u2019ll know you\\u2019re 3/4 through and the last 1/4 is only 1/3 of what you\\u2019ve already experienced. knowing what to expect or that there is end in sight is half the battle. sleep as much as you can through that time period. \\\\> i don\\u2019t know if i\\u2019m looking for advice or just someone to tell me i\\u2019m not crazy. anything helps. there\\u2018s nothing wrong with feeling crazy. we all go a little crazy sometimes. yes it's very normal to want to quit and yet not want to. you want to 1- seek help from a substance abuse counselor. not any old therapist, but someone actually trained in therapy for substance use. one activity i like for decisional balance is the 4way pro/con. draw a big + on a sheet of paper. quadrant 1 is pros of quitting. quad 2 is cons of quitting. quad 3 is pros of using. quad 4 is cons of using. be honest about what you get from using, and why you don't want to quit. because those are gonna be what you work on. how can you get those benefits without using? what can you do with your life, if you aren't stuck in addiction, that will fill the hole? how can you take care of yourself so that the cons of quitting aren't so awful? there is medication for withdrawal but it's less commonly used for coke. coke is very psychological though, and withdrawal will give you basically a short term depression. it will pass. but it takes time. like months. a psychiatrist can evaluate you for medication to help with cravings, and a short term psych med to help the mood if you desire that. this is your brain on drugs, man. it took me a long time to kind of feel normal again after kicking that habit. it sucks big time but you can do it. wishing you the best of luck. gang idk sometimes i sit in the grass and it's nice you sound like every cokehead who's hit their limit and recognize the problem. i was habitual for the past 3 years, clearing a ball every weekend and on and off the the other 7 years. it's lost its magic for me. the money wasted, never getting good sleep, and the hindrance of personal relationships. best thing i did was to just stop buying it and going into sobriety knowing i need to find something to replace the urge to shove that shit up my nose or be bored for a couple weeks until that urge is gone. hang in there, stay strong, and it will get better. embrace the withdrawal, make jokes about it, sleep a lot and give yourself time. that\\u2019s how i stopped using meth. went from a daily habit, to once every few weeks, and now it\\u2019s been months since the last time i smoked. you can do it, it\\u2019s just annoying. my libido is slowly coming back, and i\\u2019ve already made peace with the fact that those mind-blowing orgasms probably won\\u2019t happen again without smoking. my motivation is still *tiny* but i feel like it\\u2019s growing, i can feel myself finally coming out of my slump. most people who abuse stimulants are undiagnosed adhd. i\\u2019m not saying you are but i\\u2019d try and be evaluated for it. self guilt and negative self talk / emotions are common with adhd folk. go to therapy and find a new hobby you\\u2019re proud of. no one can really help you if you don\\u2019t want to actually change. it rests with you. i'm gonna drop into those conversations once a little bit of science, not so fun fact, cocaine steels, all of your dopamine, when you're coming down. you, your brain actually pushes out all of the dopamine serotone, and all those good feeling chemicals that our brain creates while you're high, and then when you come out you know, you're depleted, you absolutely have nothing left. and i hate to say this, because i hate to admit it, but i have done cocaine, and every time i did it, i felt like garbage, emotionally, physically just completely down-and-out. depressed, like i can't function. and uh to this day, i started using it when i was 17, and i'm definitely well beyond middle age, and i used it intermittently, but if i think about it, i still salivate, like it's bad. addictive, my body just wanted, and i never did it daily. i only ever did it like at parties. and with they're friends. you gotta stop it, man, cause it's, it's gonna kill you. if you don't, i've, i've lost friends, i'm sure you know that, and maybe just understanding the science behind it, that it's just a matter of regulating your body for a certain period of time. and once you've done that, you could also maybe go on some antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication to help you. there's things to do, but i don't think they'll give them to you while you're still addicted to cocaine. so you gotta get yourself a little bit sober and then you can help yourself out. then it's gonna f****** suck. just like you say, it's gonna suck for a while. but i promise you the other side, it's so much better. i have an addictive personality in i know. i know it's so much better. on the other side, i promise you, you just gotta hang in there day-by-day minute by minute hour by hour. you have to really want to live and living isn't how you feel when you're coming down from addiction, you'll have good moments. that you won't get to have when you're coming down. so don't expect it to be like that. and you probably have some therapy to do, you probably have some s*** to work through, because for as long as you've been doing the cocaine, you've been ignoring real life. and so you've got to catch up on you know the work that you should have been doing in that time that your brain was checking out. i wish you all the best. i'm positive you got this! there's aa groups for this called na. aa really helped my dad, i know they have a bad rap but they do help people get sober. please don't feel ashamed and consider reaching out to your local na group change the environment brother. environmental change will help. look up a nearby moderate hike to a mountain lake if possible and get out on the trail. jump in that lake when you get there and let the cold water remind you that you are alive and you don\\u2019t need blow to be happy. nature heals dude, also exercise it\\u2019s normal yet not but is and can\\u2019t be. the emptiness only goes away or can be handled with faith. you are the one that wants to but the voice from \\u201caddiction\\u201d which is his name - it\\u2019s that other one that is being confused as your feelings or your inner thoughts. so\\u2026.. your \\u201cmind\\u201d that produces what we call thoughts, comes form many layers of places and speaks many perspectives in either a single voice as you, or many others. the reason i say this is because once i found out that thoughts aren\\u2019t from you it was easy to break addiction. my realization was, i\\u2019m not in a battle against myself, it\\u2019s not even human. sobriety feels worse? no that is only the \\u201cextras\\u201d being in control of your body. wait what? did this guy just say that thoughts don\\u2019t come from ourselves and not from a single source and not all are form humans and not all are form live creatures? nuts right? look into: integrated information theory (iit) - giulio tononi orchestrated objective reduction (orch-or) morphic resonance primacy of consciousness (quantum monism) panpsychism break contact with your friends who you do blow with or associate blow with. delete the numbers. block them. whatever it takes psilocybin i had to commit myself to get some time to sober up. my insurance wouldn\\u2019t cover my drug of choice. pretty sure coke is going to generate better support, but please seek out that support. it\\u2019s important. you are not crazy. you're hurting. and you're in the thick of it. but the fact that you are asking these questions means that you want to stop. take it one day at a time. and get a support system in place to help you until you are stronger and able to move past the cravings. try clarior mind, it takes time to reach neutral clarity are you feeling alone op? do you have strong people around you to lean on when you feel the need to use? is there something else that used to make you happy ? pay 20 bucks a month for chatgpt and talk with it. it'll guide you through any addiction. tell it exactly what's going on at any point in time in a single conversation thread use text don't talk to it. i promise it will get better and easier with time away from it. accept that you put yourself in this situation and do whatever you can to get out of it. there will be hard times but it will only get worse with further use. more anxiety, depression, dependency, and health complications. try cbt and dbt therapies. they helped sort myself out and i use them daily. depending on where you go, you may be able to find an ibogaine clinic. ibogaine isn't legal everywhere but there are clinics you can find in the us or in mexico. it's a psychedelic that resets the system triggering the physical aspect of the addiction. you'd still need support for the emotional/mental reasons. not to sound like an ambassador for psychedelics, but ketamine has shown really promising results for depression and shifting the way you think about past hurts. joyous, if available in your state, can ship it to your house for at-home treatments (you take the lozenge, then meditate or listen to a guided visualization or revisit old traumas). all that said, i second that you should seek professional support. and you should definitely be proud of yourself for being ready to change. good luck! you need to set yourself goals that mean more then sniffing coke all day. are you healthy and in shape? are you confident in your sober body? find new hobbies to bring excitement and joy back into your life. you don't need drugs to feel happy and confident or feel something different. you can find all these things through experiencing life itself and being adventurous. get healthy, hit the gym, learn to love yourself without the mask of these drugs. i am now 2 years sober from coke and this is what i done. i was disgusted in my behaviour and who i was when i was on coke. it started off ok, and just a small habit i would engage in when i was out drinking with friends, then it turned me into a disgusting mess always wanting more, paranoid, addicted to sex and other disgusting behaviour which was enough for me to one day realise and quite cold turkey, because becoming a better me meant more! ask for help. be honest with those that love you. beg them to help keep you accountable. give yourself a week...not alone...with no work...where you can physically detox. honestly cocaine detox is about the easiest physical detox there is. (speakjng as a long term addict of multiple substances)... but the mental dependence and the habit forming behavior and ritual behind use can still be a tricky thing to shake... but then...fill your time with positive things. time with friends. the gym. positive hobbies. and cut off all your drug friends. doing this alone is horrible....if you're truly ready for a change...its time to be honest with those in your life that can help you...and ask for that help. my brother died of a brain hemorrhage from cocaine use, he was 49. let that sink in you may need medical assistance? whatever you do, don\\u2019t try heroin just stop. look into islam i tried to get clean dozens of times from uppers, and i only finally achieved it with help from a 30-day rehab and then long-term outpatient treatment. i've been going to treatment ever since i got clean more than 2 years ago. appointments and/or groups were multiple times a week at first, but now i only go once a month. recovery is so possible, i used to be a really fucked up individual. eventually, i found a reason to stay clean that was bigger than just me, and i got professional help. that's it. that's all i did. i wish you the best of luck, op. \\ud83e\\udec2 i agree i think that op bottled up their emotions too much and instead of feeling them out and crying it out, they retreat to a distraction, or something to make them forget. by doing that our body feels horrible cause you never allow it to fully process those feelings. but i know it\\u2019s hard to to face them when they creep up on us. it\\u2019s a fairly simple thing to do buts it\\u2019s not easy at all. in these times u need people around u. i say op needs to seek a therapist, a community, that will be there for them and cheer him up. i\\u2019d say start with a therapist.\",\n          \"25f \\ud83c\\udde8\\ud83c\\udde6 bestie talk to me hey hey, i\\u2019m shay! 25f \\ud83c\\udde8\\ud83c\\udde6. i\\u2019m looking for a best friend who\\u2019s also

his untreated ocd is slowly breaking me tl;dr i love my husband, but his ocd shapes every part of our life and i\\u2019m exhausted. he doesn\\u2019t think he can change. i don\\u2019t want to leave, but i don\\u2019t know how much longer i can live like this. hi all, this is really hard for me to write, and it\\u2019s taken a lot of energy just to put this into words. i\\u2019m hoping someone out there can relate or offer some perspective, because i feel like i\\u2019m drowning in silence. my husband and i have been together since we were 15. we\\u2019re now both 31, married, and we\\u2019ve shared most of our lives together. we both have mental health issues \\u2014 i have ocd and anxiety, and he has ocd, autism, and adhd. we both go to therapy, but the way we approach our struggles is very different. over the past few years, i\\u2019ve worked really hard on my ocd and anxiety. i used to be incredibly dependent on him, controlling at times, and stuck in my compulsions \\u2014 but through therapy, introspection, and genuine effort, i\\u2019ve made progress. i\\u2019m far from perfect, but i\\u2019m *better*. i\\u2019m more self-aware, and i\\u2019ve tried to reduce how much my struggles affect our life and him. my husband, on the other hand, has taken a different approach. his way of coping is avoiding involving me in his rituals. he does acknowledge he has ocd, but he\\u2019s convinced he can\\u2019t change \\u2014 that it\\u2019s just who he is, something that\\u2019s been part of him since he was 3. he\\u2019s told me he doesn\\u2019t think he can get better. and while i understand how deeply ingrained it is, that belief has left me feeling incredibly stuck. even though he keeps his rituals to himself as much as possible, the truth is, i still live under the weight of his ocd. our life revolves around it in so many ways. i follow unspoken (and spoken) rules every day \\u2014 how things should be cleaned, what\\u2019s \\\"contaminated,\\\" where i can and can\\u2019t step or touch, what i have to do to avoid triggering distress. i breathe in vinegar and alcohol regularly because that\\u2019s what he uses to clean everything. i walk on eggshells. i second-guess normal behaviors in my own home. i feel like i\\u2019ve lost parts of myself in this dynamic. i\\u2019ve silenced my discomfort, guilt, and grief just to keep the peace. but lately, i\\u2019ve been reaching a breaking point. we had a really deep conversation recently \\u2014 i cried, told him how much i\\u2019m struggling, how i sometimes think about leaving just to have a life that doesn\\u2019t revolve around constant rules and fear. and he actually said he\\u2019d understand if i left. that it would be fair. but i don\\u2019t *want* to leave. i love him. i\\u2019ve loved him my whole life. he\\u2019s my best friend. i *want* to be with him \\u2014 but not like this. not when i feel like i\\u2019m slowly disappearing. i\\u2019m scared that if nothing changes, i\\u2019ll lose myself entirely. but i\\u2019m also scared to give up on someone i love so much. i guess i\\u2019m asking\\u2026 has anyone been through something like this? has your partner ever shifted their mindset from \\u201cthis is who i am\\u201d to \\u201ci want to change, and i\\u2019ll try\\u201d? is it even fair for me to ask for that? and if it\\u2019s not possible\\u2026 how do i know when it\\u2019s time to stop fighting for something that\\u2019s hurting me? thanks for reading this far. i didn\\u2019t expect to write this much. i just feel so alone in this, and i\\u2019d really appreciate any insight or advice. i'm so sorry you're going through this, it sounds really heavy and difficult. i can tell you really love your partner. one of my favorite quotes relating to mental illness is \\\"mental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\\\" perhaps something to ponder as you navigate next steps. i want to begin by saying how sorry i am for what you\\u2019re going through. i know how hard it can be to make progress when it comes to your own mental health, but to then need to be aware of someone else\\u2019s constantly? sounds exhausting. i haven\\u2019t dealt with this with a partner, but i did want to share an experience i had with my ocd group. so, when i began group therapy i was, for lack of a better term, a mess. i laid in bed all day, only getting up to go to the bathroom twice and eat once per day because the compulsions surrounding both took hours. when i started group i immediately formed an attachment to these folks who knew exactly what i was going through. for about a year and a half we all chatted constantly and i felt so insanely connected to these people. but then. i started getting better. i was doing super difficult exposures and becoming more aware of myself. as i progressed i realized that i was only connected to these people via my ocd. i eventually got to where i am now, i have a job, i can take care of myself, i can do normal every day rhings without being overloaded with compulsions. but so many people from that group have not made that kind of progress, whether by choice or not. and eventually i realized i was just at a different place than them. it didn\\u2019t mean i didn\\u2019t love and care for these people who had supported me and given me so much advice, but it was just draining me to keep in contact with them. i always felt pressured to go to group therapy even though i really felt i didn\\u2019t need it anymore, i felt that my ocd would spike when i would catch up on chat messages because they talked about it all the time, i felt bad for my progress when i shared a win etc. so i eventually just kind of separated myself from them and it was the best thing i\\u2019ve ever done for me and my mental health. no matter the course you take i am sending you the best vibes. suffering in silence only passes the buck to a later you. unfortunately, if he\\u2019s not going to change, you need to decide if you\\u2019re willing to deal with it for the rest of your life because he straight up told you that he would understand if you left indicating that he really won\\u2019t change. or you leave him because you can\\u2019t deal with it. are you willing to lose him because you can\\u2019t handle him anymore or are you willing to keep living the way you are except understanding that you stayed so you know what you\\u2019re signing up for? it\\u2019s going to be a tough decision regardless. you two could go to couple\\u2019s therapy since it seems like both of you are open to therapy. in any case, i hope things work out for you. it\\u2019s clear he doesn\\u2019t want to change, he\\u2019s even willing to let you leave instead of getting help and changing his ways. try another conversation asking him to get help, and if it doesn\\u2019t work i think you have to leave. you\\u2019ll start to resent him, i went through something similar. my boyfriend has depression and he wasn\\u2019t taking his medication on purpose and not improving with therapy. i texted him asking if he wanted to get better. he was honest and said no, he asked if it was affecting me and told him it was. he\\u2019s been trying to heal now. when he wasn\\u2019t trying to heal it really brought be down and resented him, it felt like he was bringing me down with him. it sounds like your options are leave him, go down with him, or try another conversation. the most healthy option would be leaving, you can\\u2019t help someone who doesn\\u2019t want to be helped, they have to want it themselves. of course i don\\u2019t fully know your situation but the fact that he\\u2019s more okay with you leaving than getting some help or going to therapy is a pretty big red flag i know how debilitating ocd can be, i\\u2019m also in a relationship where my ocd is affecting me and my partners relationship, but it\\u2019s because i love them that i went to a psychiatrist and i\\u2019m starting therapy soon and willing to try to work on it edit: grammar, wording as someone who deeply relates! i have ocd and asperger\\u2019s too, i want to offer a bit of perspective. what brings him peace is probably creating distance from the things that trigger his anxiety. that\\u2019s why he does so much alone. i do the same, it\\u2019s not about pushing anyone away, it\\u2019s about keeping my world manageable and predictable. but i completely understand how, for you, that distance can feel like emotional abandonment. my wife felt the same way. what ended up helping us was building structure together. we created \\u201cmy days,\\u201d \\u201cher days,\\u201d and \\u201cour days.\\u201d my days are for me to recharge, manage my routines, and have space without pressure. her days are hers to do what she needs without worrying about me. our days are intentional time together, whether that\\u2019s talking, doing something low-stress, or just being present with each other. this system helped my ocd because it gave structure and predictability. but more importantly, it protected our relationship. it gave my wife the emotional connection she needed and gave me the space i needed to function. it\\u2019s not a perfect fix, but it created breathing room and mutual respect. it took for my wife to say exactly how she feels and how much it pained her for to work even harder at my exposure therapy and to speak to my doctor for upping my doses. i can\\u2019t imagine how hard this is for you. from the start i wanted to feel better once i found out i had ocd. make sure and tell him how you feel and don\\u2019t sugar coat it. maybe it will spark a fire under him i don\\u2019t really know if what i am about to type is directly relevant, or helpful admittedly, but i just want to echo some of the sentiments of the other commenters, as well as sharing some of my own experiences from the perspective of someone with ocd in a long-term relationship. firstly, i\\u2019m sorry you\\u2019re in this situation, and it\\u2019s a lot to deal with. in terms of attitudes surrounding seeking change vs \\u201cthis is the way i am\\u201d\\u2026 unfortunately, for treatment to be successful, your partner will need to reach a point where the desire for change will be genuine. i\\u2019ve read quite a lot of work from psychologists, and the psychologist i\\u2019m currently under the care of essentially wrote something to the effect of \\u201cassessing why they want treatment at this moment cannot be understated; if they are here due to being pressured by relatives, adherence to treatment can often be less than ideal\\u201d. i resisted change for years because i was scared - terrified, even. i tried a few times, but i couldn\\u2019t commit to getting the sort of help i needed because i was afraid, and didn\\u2019t want to face it. i reached a point one day where i realised i couldn\\u2019t keep going the way i was anymore, and decided to see a psychologist, with the intention that i would throw myself at whatever they asked me to do 100%. i felt that i could no longer be alive with the way i felt, and something needed to change. getting to this point took years, and it took me getting to the lowest place i have ever been mentally before something \\u201cclicked\\u201d i guess. unfortunately, the answer i would give for the \\u201cknowing when to stop fighting\\u201d isn\\u2019t particularly the nicest answer, so i\\u2019m going to try and frame it as gently as i can as it sounds like you\\u2019re dealing with a lot. like a few of the other commenters have suggested, i would try talking to your husband about exactly how you feel, without sugar-coating it. i wouldn\\u2019t give him an ultimatum; i would see how they react. if they organically and genuinely move towards wanting to get help / change, and you feel you are able to, i would support them. if they push back, and double-down, it\\u2019s probably time to move on. you can\\u2019t save him if he refuses to be saved and you can\\u2019t let it drag you down too he should be on medication or in therapy or both. i use both. any chance he can just try meds? meds helped my cleaning ocd. therapy didn\\u2019t. zoloft specifically. but please note it needs to be a therapeutic dose. i\\u2019m seeing significant improvement at 150 mgs. cleaning ocd is weird because it\\u2019s acceptable in our society. walk in any cvs down the cleaning aisle and you can see how obsessed our society is with disinfecting and cleaning. it\\u2019s deeply important to many people to have a clean and sanitary home at all times- in fact, it\\u2019s a sign of being a functioning adult. my ocd latched on to that and i told myself my cleanliness was just part of my identity. but there was a point in my life when i was taking 8 showers a day. a point when i couldn\\u2019t go into my basement without fear of contamination. a point when every surface in my house needed to be sanitized before going to sleep. it\\u2019s extremely tiring and if left untreated it will get worse. but once i got on a therapeutic dose of zoloft my life started changing. for example i\\u2019m lying on my bed right now in my outside clothing. this would have literally been impossible for me a month ago. i also haven\\u2019t washed my sheets in almost *two weeks* which is literally insane progress. there is hope for cleaning ocd! awful situation however living apart (but still being together) may be a work around? that way you both can choose how to deal with your own struggles without being triggered/ being triggering? i really hope you find a solution as i understand as the person with ocd whilst my partner has no mental illness is it possible for you to live apart but still be together? this way he gets to do things at home his way and you won't have to deal with it. some couples do this and it works well for them. i am going through this and we need to set up a support group zoom call. my husband is howard hughes. we are going through 15 rolls of paper towels a week. it is the exercise rituals 3 hours a day.... panics about touching metal. dish soap constantly. obsessing over the trash man/mail/any bill that is due. plastic bags around the house, rerun episodes on tv, tracking business hours, traffic lights, birthdays, sports betting, and controlling every bank. hoarding millions of dollars away in banks and brokerage accounts, planning out schedules. obsessing over our daughter for endless hours. complete codependent crazy town. he hovers over her constantly. this is setting her up for a dysfunctional marriage. constant hand washing. avoiding extra romance. sleeping with blankets near the fire and needing to be 110 degrees to sleep. sweating like a sauna. i get no comfort in bed. pulling out extention cords and appliances constantly. tracking everything in the refrigerator. i am so burned out also. dm me hello! i dealt with this for a few years with my partner until he got bad enough that i sat down with him and insisted he try something, ideally medication for his situation. he was brave enough to try. so far, the medication fluloxitine has been greatly helpful to him, especially with contamination issues. best of luck, friend. you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home! i\\u2019m sorry this is weighing on you heavily. i don\\u2019t have much advise but just as your husband gets a certain comfort from the cleanliness and rituals, you deserve a certain comfort in existing within your own four walls, too. it\\u2019s your home and shouldn\\u2019t be a place that fills you with so much anxiety and dread. i hope you guys find a way to work through this <3 sometimes ocd feels like your identity because it wants to control and give you the sense that you control every aspect of your life, its about time that he will realise he's more than his diagnosis, hopefully he can come around to it, but also keep your boundaries and don't get dragged if he's unwilling to change, it does become manageable and it has a great number of people that can live a healthy and easy life with it, he just probably is unsure of who he is outside his disorder, it happens. i think you\\u2019re great for sticking by his side. maybe you should take him to the people who helped you and see what they can do for him. it seems he doesn\\u2019t want to change so try and show him how much better you feel having your ocd how it is now. if even after all of that he refuses to change, then i think he\\u2019d understand if you could be with him anymore. i\\u2019m curious. what kind of ocd does he have? just wanted to comment as i have ocd and often feel very sad for what i have and continue to put my husband through - i dream of another life where he has a care free wife allowing him to enjoy things to the fullest. my big one is also contamination and my husband does things like washing his hands after opening the front door/doing laundry/picking something off the floor/wiping packages - small stuff most people probably don't do but i ingrained it into the poor guy. does your husband seem to have any sympathy for you? why do you think he does not want to at least try to reduce his compulsions or the ones he needs you to also follow? i do think some folks with ocd get worse as they age, that may be playing a part (not impossible to recover from just takes more work). in any healthy dynamic it is a deal breaker if one partner is causing the other distress and refuses to stop or work to improve. is he willing to work on himself? maybe a temporary separation, while he gets help and you find yourself a little bit again? i went through this for verbatim except the autism part with my husband. see my last year's post. i no longer participate in his rituals, and he found a spiritual journey to pursue different rituals in, but he still does his cleaning rituals, mostly on his own now. i still adhere to some of his rules, but he knows i'm not happy with them, but i notice the less he stresses and i don't react the less he does clean and become very bad with cleaning all day. the calmer he is, the less it's triggered. meditation and affirmations work. he also got on a mushroom gummy called reshi and takes saffron gummies every day, which has calmed him down. i can message you pics of the exact supplements if you want. girll my partner has ocd, great and i love him but the main reason why i'm sticking is cause he's always trying to get better, do better, far from healed but he's putting in the effort for a good life, a future together and that means the world to me. i would not have stayed without this no matter how much i love him. but i feel you. i'm so sorry, it's not an easy place to be in, seeing your partner struggle is a different kind of pain. i truly wish he decides to get help and learn to manage without engaging in his compulsions, if he doesn't, i'd advise you to leave. maybe you leaving would be a wake up call but don't count on it. i'd say that you need to see at least a belief and an attempt at changing. no matter if it fails. but it's very hard live with a loved person and see them spiraling down, see them cowardly give up on themselves, merely out of fear of facing such an annoying condition. it's not like it's a seven headed dragon or something like that. which is what my (ex?) girlfriend does. avoids facing it, avoids talking about it, gets angry if anyone mentions it. endless compulsions. every day i think i should leave. i feel a lot like your husband sometimes, like i\\u2019m incurable and stuck and i\\u2019m just like this. but my mindset changed when eventually my boyfriend just said \\u201cyou always tell me that nobody understands, and that you\\u2019re all alone, and that you\\u2019re gonna be like this forever, but you literally aren\\u2019t that unique. there\\u2019s no proof that you\\u2019re gonna be the first person in the world who can\\u2019t possibly get better\\u201d and it made me feel stupid at first but then i realized he was right i\\u2019m having a similar issue with my partner but not quite as bad i don\\u2019t think. there\\u2019s also other disability\\u2019s involved and trauma so kinda heavy. biggest issue is the same tho that they don\\u2019t think they can change. also they are so bad at communicating. i love them more than anything but i\\u2019m so emotionally exhausted. this is my perfect answer thanks \\u2665\\ufe0f wish you both the best and hope you fight this evil illness \\ud83d\\udcaa i am at an exactly same point where you were. this is so tiring and exhausting, but i was taking fluoxetine 60 mg and it did not help. maybe i will try zoloft. happy for you though, i know how tough it is.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_len\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
